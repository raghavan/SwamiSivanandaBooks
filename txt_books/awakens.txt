SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES

SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES

The entrance into the higher meditative life depends upon the grace of God.

The higher meditative life demands tremendous humility, serenity and courage.

In higher meditative life the senses and the mind are completely subdued. There is no more

use of the mind, emotions and imaginations.

In higher meditation the Yogi withdraws himself completely and enters into the state of

consciousness above the mind and intellect. He is conscious only of Pure Being.

In Samadhi or the superconscious state the Yogi abandons the sense of his own being and

enters into the Being of God.

Spiritual experience will come to you when you are ready, but not before.

There is inner unfolding from level to level in your spiritual experience. Wait patiently.

Plod on in your Sadhana with purity and courage.

Like draws like on your spiritual journey. You are never really left alone. You will get help
from Yogis and Saints internally, from different parts of the world. Their spiritual vibrations will
elevate and inspire you.

Meditate and enter into the realm of radiant light. There are no limitations; here there is no

worry, there are no obstacles.

There is no time or space. In that holy realm there is no fear, no doubt, no indecision. It is all

eternal joy, bliss, peace and happiness.

Morality is the gateway to religion.
Morality is the gateway to bliss immortal.
The aim of morality is to raise man to the level of divinity by transforming his own nature.
Be good; do good. This is the essence of morality.

MORALITY

IMMORALITY

It is immoral to drink liquor.
It is immoral to hurt others.
It is immoral to give way to anger.
It is immoral to tell lies or deceive others.
It is immoral to entertain lustful thoughts.
It is immoral to hate or cavil others.
It is immoral to burst out in anger.

THUS AWAKENS SWAMI SIVANANDA

VIRTUE

Virtue is the root of happiness; therefore be virtuous.
Virtue will open the gates of immortality to receive you.
Virtue has divinity behind it; wherever is divinity there is virtue.
Virtue does not come from money; but every good of man comes from virtue.

MEDITATE ON TWELVE VIRTUES

Humility in January.
Frankness in February.
Courage in March.
Mercy in May.
Magnanimity in June.
Sincerity in July.
Pure love in August.
Generosity in September.
Forgiveness in October.

VOICE OF SIVA

Think truly. Speak truly. Live truly. Act truly.

To be pure, to be spiritual, is to be true.

Truthfulness is the first pillar in the temple of the Lord.

Practice of truth will gradually transform your life.

Truth is the bestower of immortality and bliss divine.

Being truthful means stating a thing as it is or expressing a thing as it is.

Truth denotes the practising of all the divine virtues.

If you want quick progress in the spiritual life, if you are to attain God realisation, then

adhere to truth without any selfish consideration.

Truth is the very core and essence of the law of God, which is the foundation of all spiritual

practices and divine life.

MY MISSION

MY MISSION

I organise medical missions of relief as means of promoting the spirituality of Universal

brotherhood and peace.

I organise moral missions to directly preach the gospel of Universal fellowship and the
fundamental unity of mankind. This also will promote world peace. There will be cultural conquest
or triumph of truth through Dharma or righteousness.

I do not believe in the military conquest, achieved by force and violence. I believe in moral
conquest, conquest of hearts, conquest by love and establishing the spiritual empire of
righteousness, without any geographical and national frontiers.

The Divine Life Society branches,

the Divine Life members and the Divine Life
Conferences are doing wonderful work towards the establishment of Universal brotherhood, world
peace and Universal Atmanhood.

My work is to rouse the religious consciousness, the awareness of the essential divinity of

man.

I have laid great emphasis in all my writings upon the discipline of the outgoing senses,

conquest of the mind, purification of the heart and attainment of inner peace and strength.

I have appeared in this age to indicate the way unto men. The way is: simplify your life,
purify your heart. Slay egoism, and pride, cultivate cosmic love, practise self-discipline. Serve all.
Love all. Hear, reflect, meditate. Enquire and know Thyself. Live in the Eternal.

TWENTY SPIRITUAL SPARKS

1. I follow the religion of love.

2. I am a true Christian, a true Musalman, a true Hindu, a true Buddhist, a true Sikh and a

true Parsi.

3. I can come nearer to you, but you must draw me by a purified heart and a strong, pure will.

specially treasures, but there are also essential aspects common to all.

5. All prophets have only delivered and proclaimed in different languages the same

principles of Eternal Goodness and Eternal Truth.

6. The lovers of God have no religion, but God alone.

creation.

THUS AWAKENS SWAMI SIVANANDA

8. Man is spiritually impoverished. He has the need for religion. And there is a need for

co-operation among religions.

9. Man’s pilgrimage through the many to the one is the most sacred pilgrimage. His

pilgrimage is his journey through sorrow and pain to the goal of bliss in God.

pillows, but not sound sleep. Money can help you to get material comforts, but not eternal bliss.
Money can help you to get ornaments, but not beauty. Money will help you to get an electric
earphone, but not natural hearing. Attain the supreme wealth wisdom, you will have everything.

11. Pain and death exist. Their ultimate cause is ignorance. Their cure is knowledge of

Brahman or experience of the eternal bliss of the Supreme Self.

12. One need not necessarily or always have to wait for another birth to enjoy the fruits of
present Karmas. According to the demerit of the Karmas one can experience their fruits within
years, months, weeks, or days.

13. Ethics and spiritual practices open the door to Truth or the spirit.

14. Let your service be free from the taint of seeking recognition, power or position. Let

your motive be altruistic.

15. Sacrifice means an act directed to the welfare of all life without receiving or desiring a

return for it, either of a temporal or spiritual nature.

Truth and Bliss.

spiritual path.

17. Endeavour enables man to endure and endurance stimulates his endeavour.

18. Purification, illumination, unification, perfection and liberation are the stages in the

19. Samadhi is seeing things as a whole as one.

God-consciousness. Plunge in the river of eternal life. Behold the eternal light of Divine Beauty.
