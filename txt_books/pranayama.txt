PUBLISHERS’ NOTE

It is needless for us to stress on the merits of the subject or its author, Sri Swami Sivanandaji
Maharaj. Sri Swamiji already lives in the hearts of the people of the world as an ‘unfailing saviour’.
The Swamiji’s method of presenting such intricate Yogic subjects in an inimitable, simple style
with convincing assurances in unique and unrivalled. It is authoritative, the more so, because of
Swamiji being a combination of an experienced medical practitioner, a full-blown Yogi and a
Jivanmukta.

The practice of Pranayama has been viewed with fear in certain quarters on account of
certain limitations, viz., the absolute necessity of the nearness to a perfected Guru, the dietetic
restrictions and the like. Sri Swamiji has explained herein in clear terms the vagaries of such fears
and has prescribed very simple and safe methods. The book contains suitable lessons for all types of
Sadhakas. Those who follow the special instructions given towards the end of the book can be sure
of their guaranteed success and safety.

Pranayama is an important Anga in Ashtanga Yoga. It is equally necessary for all in their
daily life, for good health, success and prosperity in every walk of life. How it is so, is explained in
these pages. The science of relaxation is a very valuable gift for the readers and would benefit all.

We are greatly encouraged by the warm reception the previous editions had at the hands of
our dear readers and we hope more and more Sadhakas would take up this important aspect of
Sadhana in their daily spiritual practices, and feel for themselves the happiness and joy which will
naturally lead them to blissful ‘Divine Life’.

INTRODUCTION

Today, for quick travel, the material world presents us the Railway, Steamers, Aeroplanes
and so forth, but the Yogins claim that by Yogic culture the weight of the body can be so reduced
that it can fly over the space to any distance in an instant. They can prepare a magic ointment, which
when applied to the soles of the feet, gives them power to traverse any distance on earth within a
very short time. By the practice of Khechari Mudra, by applying the elongated tongue to the
posterior nasal openings they can fly in the air. By keeping a magic pill in their mouth they can also
move in space to any place in the twinkling of an eye. When we are anxious to know the welfare of
our own relations in a distant or foreign land, we take recourse to writing letters sending ordinary or
urgent cables. But the Yogins claim that they can, by meditation (Dyana), know anything that
happens in other parts of the world by a projection of the mind or by mentally travelling the distance
which is only a matter of few seconds. Yogi Lahiri, whose Samadhi is still in Varanasi, travelled to
London to see the state of health of his superior’s wife. For hearing a friend at a long distance the
material world presents us with telephones and wireless receivers, but the Yogins claim that
through their Yogic power, they can hear anything, from any distance, even the voices of God and
other invisible beings in the firmament. Today when a man is suffering from a disease the material
world presents us with doctors, medicines, injections and so forth, but the Yogins claim that by a

iii

mere glance or by simple touch or by recitation of Mantras, not only the diseases can be cured but
also life can be given to a dead man.

These Yogins by persistent effort in concentration get different Yogic powers that are
known as ‘Siddhis’. Those who acquire these Siddhis, are known as Siddhas. The process through
which they obtain Siddhis, is called Sadhana. Pranayama is one of the most important Sadhanas.
Through the practice of Asana, you can control the physical body and through Pranayama, you can
control the subtle, astral body or the Linga Sarira. As there is an intimate connection between the
breath and nerve-currents, control of breath leads to the control of vital inner currents.

Pranayama occupies a very important place in Indian religion. Every Brahmachari, and
every Grihastha also, has to practise it three times every day morning, noon and evening in his daily
worship during Sandhya. It precedes every religious practice of the Hindus. Before he eats, before
he drinks, before he resolves to do anything, Pranayama should be performed first and then the
nature of his determination should be clearly enunciated and placed before the mind. The facts of its
preceding every effort of the will is a surety that, that effort will be crowned with success and the
mind will be directed to bring about the desired result. Here I may refer to the feat of memory,
practised by the Hindu Yogins, under the name of concentration on one hundred things.
‘Satavadhana’, wherein one hundred questions are put to a Satavadhani or the concentrator in rapid
succession by different persons; some testing the verbal memory of the performer; others testing his
power of mental calculation; again some others, trying to test his artistic skill, without giving him,
any time for committing the questions to have been put to him. The performer begins, by
reproducing the questions, in any order, in respect of those questions, with their answers. This is
generally done in three or more turns, in each turn giving only a portion of the answer to each of the
questions and then continuing from where he left off in the next turn. If the questions are of the
nature of mathematical problems whose solutions are required, he delivers the answers along with
the problems, having solved them mentally.

This faculty of concentration of mind is often exhibited not only with reference to the
intellect but also with reference to the five senses. A number of bells may be marked differently and
the sounds may be allowed to be studied and made mental note of with the mark given to it. A
number of objects of similar shape and colour which are likely to cause deception to the eye of an
ordinary man may be shown once to the ‘Avadhani’ with their marks. While he is attending to other
things, if a bell were to be struck or one of the objects suddenly exhibited before his sight, he will at
once mention the mark of the bell or the number of the object shown. Similarly his keenness of
touch is also put to the test. Such feats of memory are due to the training which they receive from the
daily practice of Pranayama.

The Prana may be defined as the finest vital force in everything which becomes visible on
the physical plane as motion and action and on the mental plane as thought. The word Pranayama,
therefore, means the restraint of vital energies. It is the control of vital energy which tingles through
the nerves of persons. It moves his muscles and causes him to sense the external world and think his
internal thought. This energy is of such a nature that it may be called the vis viva of the animal
organism. The control of this force is what is aimed at by the Yogins by means of Pranayama. He
who conquers this, is not only the conqueror of his own existence on the physical and mental plane,
but the conqueror of the whole world. For, the Prana is the very essence of cosmic life, that subtle

iv

principle which evolved the whole universe into its present form and which is pushing it towards its
ultimate goal. To the Yogi the whole universe is his body. The matter which composes his body is
the same that evolved the universe. The force which pulsates through his nerves is not different
from the force which vibrates through the universe. The conquest over the body does, therefore,
mean to him the conquest over the forces of nature. According to the Hindu Philosophy the whole
nature is composed of two principal substances. One of them is called the Akasa or ether and the
other, Prana or energy. These two may be said to correspond to matter and force of the modern
scientists. Everything in this universe that possesses form or that has material existence, is evolved
out of this omnipresent and all-pervasive subtle substance ‘Akasa’. Gas, liquid and solid, the whole
universe, consisting of our solar system and millions of huge systems like ours and in fact every
kind of existence that may be brought under the word ‘created’, are the products of this one subtle
and invisible Akasa and at the end of each cycle return to the starting point. In the same way, all the
way of forces of nature that are known to man; gravitation, light, heat, electricity, magnetism all
those that can be grouped under the generic name of ‘energy’, physical creation, nerve-currents, all
such as are known as animal forces and thought and other intellectual forces also, may be said to be
the manifestations of the cosmic Prana. From Prana, they spring into existence and in Prana, they
finally subside. Every kind of force in this universe, physical or mental can be resolved into this
original force. There can be nothing new except these two factors in some one of their forms.
Conservation of matter and conservation of energy are the two fundamental laws of nature. While
one teaches that the sum total of Akasa forming the universe, is constant, the other teaches that the
sum total of energy that vibrates the universe, is also a constant quantity. At the end of each cycle
the different manifestations of energy quiet down and become potential: so also the Akasa which
becomes indistinguishable: but at the beginning of the next cycle the energies start up again and act
on the Akasa so as to involve the various forms. Accordingly, when the Akasa changes and
becomes gross or subtle, Prana also changes and becomes gross or subtle. As the human body is
only a microcosm to a Yogi, his body composed of the nervous system and the internal organs of
perception represent to him, the microcosmic Akasa, the nerve-currents and thought-currents, and
the cosmic Prana. To understand the secrets of their workings and to control them is, therefore, to
get the highest knowledge and the conquest of the universe.

He who has grasped this Prana, has grasped the very core of cosmic life and activity. He
who has conquered and controlled this very essence, has not only subjected his own body and mind
but every other body and mind in this universe. Thus Pranayama or the control of Prana is that
means by which the Yogi tries to realise in his little body the whole of cosmic life, and tries to attain
perfection by getting all the powers in this universe. His various exercises and trainings are for this
one end.

Why delay? Delay means so much of additional suffering and misery. Let us increase the
speed, struggle harder until we succeed in bridging over the vast chasm of time. By doing proper
Sadhana let us attain the goal at once in this body, right now in this very moment. Why not we get
that infinite knowledge, infinite bliss, infinite peace and infinite power, now alone?

The solution of the problem is the teaching of Yoga. The whole science ‘Yoga’ has this one
end in view,—to enable man to cross the ocean of Samsara, to increase power, to develop
knowledge and to attain immortality and eternal bliss.

Chapter One

Prana and Pranayama

Pranayama is an exact science. It is the fourth Anga or limb of Ashtanga Yoga. “Tasmin
Sati Svasa prasvasayorgativicchedah Pranayamah”—Regulation of breath or the control of Prana
is the stoppage of inhalation and exhalation, which follows after securing that steadiness of posture
or seat, Asana. Thus is Pranayama defined in Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Chapter II-49.

‘Svasa’ means inspiratory breath and ‘Prasvasa’ is expiratory breath. Breath is external
manifestation of Prana, the vital force. Breath like electricity, is gross Prana. Breath is Sthula, gross.
Prana is Sukshma, subtle. By exercising control over this breathing you can control the subtle Prana
inside. Control of Prana means control of mind. Mind cannot operate without the help of Prana. The
vibrations of Prana only produce thoughts in the mind. It is Prana that moves the mind. It is Prana
that sets the mind in motion. It is the Sukshma Prana or Psychic Prana that is intimately connected
with the mind. This breath represents the important fly-wheel of an engine. Just as the other wheels
stop when the driver stops the fly-wheel, so also other organs cease working, when the Yogi stops
the breath. If you can control the fly-wheel, you can easily control the other wheels. Likewise, if
you can control the external breath, you can easily control the inner vital force, Prana. The process
by which the Prana is controlled by regulation of external breath, is termed Pranayama.

Just as a goldsmith removes the impurities of gold by heating it in the hot furnace, by
strongly blowing the blow-pipe, so also the Yogic student removes the impurities of the body and
the Indriyas by blowing his lungs, i.e., by practising Pranayama.

The chief aim of Pranayama is to unite the Prana with the Apana and take the united
Pranapana slowly towards the head. The effect or fruit of Pranayama is Udghata or awakening of
the sleeping Kundalini.

What is Prana?

“He who knows Prana knows Vedas” is the important declaration of the Srutis. You will
find in Vedanta Sutras: “For the same reason, breath is Brahman.” Prana is the sum total of all
energy that is manifest in the universe. It is the sum total of all the forces in nature. It is the sum total
of all latent forces and powers which are hidden in men and which lie everywhere around us. Heat,
light, electricity, magnetism are the manifestations of Prana. All forces, all powers and Prana spring
from the fountain or common source, ‘Atman’. All physical forces, all mental forces come under
the category ‘Prana’. It is force on every plane of being, from the highest to the lowest. Whatever
moves or works or has life, is but an expression or manifestation of Prana. Akasa or ether also is an
expression of Prana. The Prana is related to mind and through mind to will, and through will to the
individual soul, and through this to the Supreme Being. If you know how to control the little waves
of Prana working through the mind, then the secret of subjugating universal Prana will be known to
you. The Yogi who becomes an expert in the knowledge Of this secret, will have no fear from any
power, because he has mastery over all the manifestations of powers in the universe. What is
commonly known as power of personality is nothing more than the natural capacity of a person to

1

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

wield his Prana. Some persons are more successful in life, more influential and fascinating than
others. It is all due to the power of this Prana. Such people manipulate everyday, unconsciously of
course, the same influence which the Yogi uses consciously by the command of his will. There are
others who by chance tumble unaware of this Prana and use it for lower purposes under false names.
This working of Prana is seen in the systolic and diastolic actions of the heart, when it pumps the
blood into arteries in the action of inspiration and expiration during the course of breathing; in the
digestion of food; in the excretion of urine and faecal matter; in the manufacture of semen, chyle,
chyme, gastric juice, bile, intestinal juice, saliva; in closing and opening of the eyelids, in walking,
playing, running, talking, thinking, reasoning, feeling and willing. Prana is the link between the
astral and physical body. When the slender thread-link Prana is cut off the astral body separates
from the physical body. Death takes place. The Prana that was working in the physical body is
withdrawn into the astral body.

This Prana remains in a subtle, motionless, unmanifested, undifferentiated state during the
cosmic Pralaya. When the vibration is set up, Prana moves and acts upon Akasa, and brings forth
the various forms. The macrocosm (Brahmanda) and microcosm (Pindanda) are combinations of
Prana (energy) and Akasa (matter).

That which moves the steam-engine of a train and a steamer, that which makes the
aeroplanes fly in air, that which causes the motion of the breath in lungs, that which is the very life
of this breath itself, is Prana. I believe, you have now a comprehensive understanding of the term
Prana about which you had a very vague conception in the beginning.

By controlling the act of breathing you can efficiently control all the various motions in the
body and the different nerve-currents that are running through the body. You can easily and quickly
control and develop body, mind and soul through breath-control or the control of Prana. It is
through Pranayama that you can control your circumstances and character and can consciously
harmonise the individual life with the cosmic life.

The breath, directed by thought under the control of the will, is a vitalising, regenerating
force which you can utilise consciously for self-development; for healing many incurable diseases
in your system; for healing others and for other various useful purposes.

It is within your easy reach at every moment of your life. Use it judiciously. Many Yogins of
yore, like Sri Jnanadeva, Trailinga Swami, Ramalinga Swami and others, had utilised this breath,
this force, the Prana, in a variety of ways. You can also do so, if you practise Pranayama by
prescribed breathing exercises. It is Prana that you are breathing rather than the atmospheric air.
Inhale slowly and steadily with a concentrated mind. Retain it as long as you can do it comfortably.
Then exhale slowly. There should be no strain in any stage of Pranayama. Realise the occult inner
life-powers which underlie the breath. Become a Yogi and radiate joy, light and power all around
you. Pranavadins or Hatha Yogins consider that Prana Tattva is superior to Manas Tattva, the
mind-principle. They say, Prana is present even when the mind is absent during sleep. Hence Prana
plays a more vital part than the mind. If you go through the parables in Kaushitaki and Chhandogya
Upanishads, when all the Indriyas, mind and Prana fight amongst themselves as to their superiority,
you will find that Prana is regarded as the highest of all. Prana is the oldest, for it starts its
functioning from the very moment the child is conceived. On the contrary, the organs of hearing,

2

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

etc., begin to function only when their special abodes, viz., the ears, etc., are formed. Prana is called
Jyeshtha and Sreshtha (oldest and best) in Upanishads. It is through the vibrations of psychic Prana
that the life of the mind, Sankalpa or thinking is kept up and thought is produced. You see, hear,
talk, sense, think, feel, will, know, etc., through the help of Prana and therefore Srutis declare:
“Prana is Brahman.”

Seat of Prana

The seat of Prana is heart. Though the Antahkarana is one, yet it assumes four forms, viz., (i)
Manas, (ii) Buddhi, (iii) Chitta and (iv) Ahamkara according to the different functions it performs.
Likewise, though Prana is one, it assumes five forms viz., (1) Prana, (2) Apana, (3) Samana, (4)
Udana and (5) Vyana according to the different functions it performs. This is termed as Vritti
Bheda. The principal Prana is called Mukhya Prana. The Prana, joined with Ahamkara, lives in the
heart. Of these five, Prana and Apana are the chief agents.

The seat of Prana is the heart; of Apana, the anus; of Samana, the region of the naval; of

Udana, the throat; while Vyana is all-pervading. It moves all over the body.

Sub-Pranas and Their Functions

Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya are the five sub-Pranas.

The function of Prana is respiration; Apana does excretion; Samana performs digestion;
Udana does deglutition (swallowing of the food). It takes the Jiva to sleep. It separates the astral
body from the physical body at the time of death. Vyana performs circulation of blood.

Naga does eructation and hiccup. Kurma performs the function of opening the eyes. Krikara
induces hunger and thirst. Devadatta does yawning. Dhananjaya causes decomposition of the body
after death. That man is never reborn, whenever he may die, whose breath goes out of the head, after
piercing the Brahmarandhra.

The Colour of Pranas

Prana is said to be of the colour of blood, red gem or coral. Apana which is in the middle, is
of the colour of Indragopa (an insect of white or red colour). Samana is of the colour between that of
pure milk or crystal or of oily and shining colour, i.e., of something between both Prana and Apana.
Udana is of Apandura (pale white) colour and that of Vyana, resembles the colour of archil (or that
of ray of light).

The Length of the Air-Currents

This body of Vayu is 96 digits (6 feet) in length as a standard. The ordinary length of the
air-current, when exhaled is 12 digits (9 inches). In singing, its length becomes 16 digits (1 foot), in
eating it comes to 20 digits (15 inches), in sleeping 30 digits (22 1/2 inches), in copulation 36 digits
(27 inches) and in doing physical exercise it is much more than that. By decreasing the natural

3

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

length of the expirer air-currents (from 9 inches), life is prolonged and by increasing the current,
duration of life is decreased.

The Centering of the Prana

Inhaling the Prana from outside, filling the stomach with it, centre the Prana with the mind,
in the middle of the navel, at the tip of the nose, and at the toes, during the ‘Sandhyas’ (sunrise and
sunset) or at all times. Thus the Yogi is freed from all diseases and fatigues. By centering this Prana
at the tip of the nose he obtains mastery over the elements of the air; by centering at the middle of his
navel, all diseases are destroyed; by centering at the toes, his body becomes light. He who drinks air
through the tongue destroys his fatigue, thirst and many other diseases. For him who drinks the air
with his mouth, during the two Sandhyas and the last two hours of the night, within three months,
the auspicious Sarasvati (Goddess of speech) is present in his Vak (speech), i.e., he becomes
eloquent and learned. In six months he is free from all diseases. Drawing the air at the root of the
tongue, the wise man thus drinking nectar enjoys all prosperity.

The Lungs

It will not be out of place here to mention a word on lungs and their functions. The organs of
respiration consist of two lungs, one on either side of the chest and the air passages that lead to them.
They are located in the upper thoracic cavity of the chest, one on each side of median line. They are
separated from each other by the heart, the greater blood vessels and the larger air-tubes. The lungs
are spongy, porous and their tissues are very elastic. The substance of the lungs contains
innumerable air-sacs, which contain air. After post-mortem, when it is placed in a basin of water, it
floats. They are covered by a delicate serous membrane called the pleura which contains serous
fluid to prevent friction of the lungs, during the act of breathing. One wall of the pleura closely
adheres to the lungs. The other wall is attached to the inner wall of the chest. Through this
membrane the lungs are fixed to the wall of the chest. The right lung consists of three lobes. The left
lung contains two lobes. Each lung consists of an apex and a base. The base is directed towards the
diaphragm, the muscular septum, the dividing wall between throat and abdomen. The apex situated
above, near the root of the neck. It is the base that gets inflamed in Pneumonia. The apex of the lung
which does not get proper supply of oxygen gets affected by consumption. It affords favourable
nidus or breeding ground for Tubercle Bacilli (T.B.). By the practice of Kapalabhati and Bhastrika
Pranayamas and deep breathing exercises, these apices get good supply of oxygen and thus phthisis
is obviated. Pranayama develops the lungs. He who practises Pranayama will have a powerful,
sweet, melodious voice.

The air-passage consists of the interior of the nose, pharynx or throat, larynx or the wind
box, or sounding box, which contains two vocal cords, trachea or windpipe: right and left bronchi
and the smaller bronchial tubes. When we breathe, we draw in the air through the nose and after it
has passed through the pharynx and larynx, it passes into the trachea or windpipe, thence into the
right and left bronchial tubes, which in turn, subdivide into innumerable smaller tubes called
bronchioles, and which terminate in minute subdivisions in the small air-sacs of the lungs, of which
the lungs contain millions. The air-sacs of the lungs when spread out over an unbroken surface,
would cover, an area of 1,40,000 square feet.

4

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

The air is drawn into the lungs by the action of the diaphragm. When it expands, the size of
the chest and lungs is increased and the outside air rushes into the vacuum thus created. The chest
and lungs contract, when diaphragm relaxes and the air is expelled from the lungs.

It is through vocal cords that are located in the larynx that sound is produced. Larynx is the
sounding box. When the vocal cords are affected by too much straining, as in singing and
continuous lecturing, the voice becomes hoarse. In females these cords are shorter. Hence they have
a sweet melodious voice. The number of respiration per minute is 16. In pneumonia it is increased
to 60, 70, 80 per minute. In Asthma, the bronchial tubes become spasmodic. They contract. Hence
there is difficulty in breathing. Pranayama removes the spasm or constriction of these tubes. A
small membranous flat cap covers the upper surface of larynx. It is called Epiglottis. It prevents the
food particles or water from entering into the respiratory passage. It acts the part of a safety valve.

When a small particle of food tries to enter the respiratory passage, cough comes in and the

particle is thrown out.

Lungs purify the blood. The blood starts in its arterial journey, bright-red and rich-laden
with life-giving qualities and properties. It returns by the venous route, poor, blue-laden with the
waste matter of the system. Arteries are tubes or vessels that carry pure oxygenated blood from the
heart towards the different parts of the body. Veins are vessels or tubes that carry back impure blood
from the different parts of the body. The right side of the heart contains impure venous blood. From
the right side of the heart the impure blood goes to the lungs, for purification. It is distributed among
the millions of tiny air-cells of the lungs. A breath of air is inhaled and the oxygen of the air comes
in contact with the impure blood through the thin walls of the hair-like blood-vessels of the lungs
called pulmonary capillaries. The walls of the capillaries are very thin. They are like muslin cloth or
sieve. Blood oozes out or exudes readily. Oxygen penetrates through the walls of these thin
capillaries. When the oxygen comes in contact with the tissues a form of combustion takes place.

The blood takes up oxygen and releases carbonic acid gas generated from the waste
products and poisonous matter, which has been gathered up by the blood from all parts of the
system. The purified blood is carried by the four pulmonary veins to the left auricle and thence to
the left ventricle. From the ventricle it is pumped into the biggest artery, aorta. From aorta, it passes
into the different arteries of the body. It is estimated that in a day 35,000 pints of blood traverses the
capillaries of the lungs for purification.

From the arteries the pure blood goes into the thin capillaries. From the capillaries the
lymph of the blood exudes, bathes and nourishes the tissues of the body. Tissue respiration takes
place in the tissues. Tissues take up the oxygen and leave the carbon dioxide. The impurities are
taken by the veins to the right side of the heart.

Who is the creator of this delicate structure? Are you feeling the invisible hand of God
behind these organs? The structure of this body bespeaks undoubtedly of the omniscience of the
Lord. The Antaryamin or the Indweller of our hearts supervises the working of the inner factory as
Drashtha. Without His presence, heart cannot pump blood into the arteries. Lungs cannot carry out
the process of purifying the blood. Pray. Pay your silent homage to Him. Remember Him at all
times. Feel His presence in all the cells of the body.

Ida, Pingala, Sushumna and Shat-Chakras

Ida and Pingala

There are the two nerve-currents one on either side of the spinal column. The left one is
called Ida and the right is known as Pingala. These are Nadis. Tentatively, some take these as the
right and the left sympathetic cords, but they are subtle tubes that carry Prana. The Moon moves in
the Ida and the Sun in the Pingala. Ida is cooling. Pingala is heating. Ida flows through the left
nostril and the Pingala through the right nostril. The breath flows through the right nostril for one
hour and then through the left nostril for one hour. Man is busily engaged in worldly activities,
when the breath flows through Ida and Pingala. When Sushumna operates, he becomes dead to the
world, and enters into Samadhi. A Yogi tries his level best to make the Prana run in the Sushumna
Nadi, which is known as the central Brahman Nadi also. On the left of Sushumna is situated Ida and
on the right is Pingala. The moon is of the nature of Tamas and the sun is that of the Rajas. The
poison share is of the sun and the nectar is of the moon. Ida and Pingala indicate time. Sushumna is
the consumer of time.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Sushumna

Sushumna is the most important of all the Nadis. It is the sustainer of the universe and the
path of the universe and the path of salvation. Situated at the back of the anus, it is attached to the
spinal column and extends to the Brahmarandhra of the head and is invisible and subtle. The real
work of a Yogi begins when Sushumna begins to function. Sushumna runs along the centre of the
spinal cord or spinal column. Above the genital organs and below the navel is the Kanda, of the
shape of a bird’s egg. There arise from it all the Nadis 72,000 in number. Of these, seventy-two are
common and generally known. Of those the chief ones are ten and they carry the Pranas. Ida,
Pingala, Sushumna, Gandhari, Hastijihva, Pusa, Yusasvini, Alambusa, Kuhuh and Sankhini are
said to be the ten important Nadis. The Yogis should have a knowledge of the Nadis and the
Chakras. Ida, Pingala and Sushumna are said to carry Prana and have Moon, Sun and Agni as their
Devatas. When Prana moves in Sushumna, sit for meditation. You will have deep Dhyana. If the
coiled-up energy, Kundalini, passes up along the Sushumna Nadi and is taken up from Chakra to
Chakra the Yogi gets different sorts of experiences, powers and Ananda.

Kundalini*

Kundalini is the serpent power or sleeping Sakti, that has 3 1/2 coils with face downwards,
in the Muladhara Chakra, at the base of the spine. No Samadhi is possible without its being
awakened. The practice of Kumbhaka in Pranayama produces heat and thereby Kundalini is
awakened and passes upwards along the Sushumna Nadi. The Yogic practitioner experiences
various visions. Then the Kundalini passes along the Six Chakras and eventually gets united with
Lord Siva, seated on the Sahasrara or thousand-petalled lotus, at the crown of the head. Nirvikalpa
Samadhi ensues now and the Yogi gets liberation and all the divine Aishvaryas. One should practise
control of breath with concentration of mind. The awakened Kundalini that is taken up to Manipura
Chakra may drop down again to Muladhara. It has to be raised again with effort. One should
become perfectly desireless and should be full of Vairagya before he attempts to awaken Kundalini.

Kundalini is like a thread and is resplendent. When it is awakened it hisses like a serpent
beaten with a stick and enters the hole of Sushumna. When it travels from Chakra to Chakra, layer
after layer of the mind becomes open and the Yogi acquires various Siddhis (psychic powers).

Shat-Chakras

Chakras are centres of spiritual energy. They are located in the astral body, but they have
corresponding centres in the physical body also. They can hardly be seen by the naked eyes. Only a
clairvoyant can see with his astral eyes. Tentatively they correspond to certain plexuses in the
physical body. There are six important Chakras. They are: Muladhara (containing 4 petals) at the
anus; Svadhishthana (6 petals) at the genital organ; Manipura (10 petals) at navel; Anahata (12
petals) at the heart; Visudha (16 petals) at the throat and Ajna (2 petals) at the space between the two
eyebrows. The seventh Chakra is known as Sahasrara, which contains a thousand petals. It is

located at the top of the head. Sacral plexus tentatively corresponds to Muladhara Chakra; Prostatic
plexus to Svadhishthana, Solar plexus to Manipura, Cardiac plexus to Anahata Chakra, Laryngal
plexus to Visuddha Chakra and Cavernous plexus to Ajna Chakra.

Kundalini and Muladhara Chakra

Nadis

Nadis are astral tubes made up of astral matter that carry Pranic currents. They can be seen
by the astral eyes only. They are not the nerves. They are 72,000 in number. Ida, Pingala and
Sushumna are the important ones. Sushumna is the most important of all.

Purification of Nadis

Pranayama is said to be the union of Prana and Apana. It is of three kinds—expiration,
inspiration and retention. They are associated with the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet for the right
performance of Pranayama. Pranava (!) only is said to be Pranayama. Sitting in Padmasana
(Lotus-posture) the person should meditate that there is, at the tip of his nose, Devi Gayatri, a girl of
red complexion, surrounded by numberless rays of the image of the moon and mounted on Hamsa
(Swan) having a mace in her hand. She is the visible symbol of the letter A (A). The letter U (u) has
as its visible symbol Savitri, a young lady of white colour having a disc in her hand, riding on an
eagle (Garuda). The letter M (m:˛) has as its visible symbol Sarasvati, an aged woman of black
colour, riding on a bull, having a trident in her hand. He should meditate that the single letter, the
supreme light—the Pranava OM (!) is the origin or source of these letters—A, U and M. Drawing
up the air through Ida (left nostril) for the space of 16 Matras, he should meditate on the letter A (A)
during that time, retaining the inspired air for the space of 64 Matras he should meditate on the letter

8

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

U (u) during that time; he should then exhale the inspired air for the space of 32 Matras, meditating
on the letter M (m:˛) during that time. He should practise thus in the above order again and again.

Having become firm in the posture and having preserved perfect self-control, the Yogi
should, in order to clear away the impurities of the Sushumna, sit in Padmasana, and having inhaled
the air through the left nostril, should retain it as long as he can and should exhale through the right.
Then drawing it again through the right and having retained it, he should exhale it through the left,
in the order, that he should draw it through the same nostril, by which he exhaled it before and had
retained it. To those who practise it according to these rules, through the right and left nostrils, the
Nadis become purified within three months. He should practise cessation of breath at sunrise, at
midday, at sunset and at mid-night, slowly, 80 times a day, for 4 weeks. In the early stage,
perspiration is produced; in the middle stage the tremor of the body; and in the last stage, levitation
in the air. These results ensue out of the repression of the breath, while sitting in the Padma posture.
When perspiration arises with effort, one should rub his body well. By this, the body becomes firm
and light. In the early course of practice, food with milk and ghee is excellent. One, sticking to this
rule, becomes firm in his practice and gets no Taapa (burning sensation) in the body. As lions,
elephants and tigers are gradually tamed, so also the breath, when rigidly managed, comes under
control.

By the practice of Pranayama, the purification of the Nadis, the brightening of the gastric
fire, hearing distinctly of spiritual sounds and good health result. When the nervous centres have
become purified through the regular practice of Pranayama, the air easily forces its way up through
the mouth of the Sushumna, which is in the middle. By the contraction of the muscles of the neck
and by the contraction of the one below, viz., Apana, the Prana goes into the Sushumna, which is in
the middle, from the west Nadi. Sushumna Nadi is between Ida and Pingala. The Prana which
alternates ordinarily between Ida and Pingala, is restrained by long Kumbhaka; then along with the
soul, its attendant, it will enter the Sushumna, the central Nadi, at one of three places where it yields
space for entrance through such restraint of breath, and in the navel, by the Sarasvati Nadi, on the
west. After such entry it is that the Yogi becomes dead to the world, being in that state called
Samadhi. Drawing up the Apana and forcing down the Prana from the throat, the Yogi free from old
age, becomes a youth of sixteen. Through the practice of Pranayama chronic diseases, that defy
Allopathic, Homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani doctors will be rooted out.

When the Nadis have become purified, certain external signs appear on the body of the
Yogi. They are lightness of the body, brilliancy in complexion, increase of the gastric fire, leanness
of the body, and along with these, the absence of restlessness in the body. They are all signs of
purification.

Shat-Karmas (The Six Purificatory Processes)

Those who are of a flabby and phlegmatic constitution only, should practise at first these six
Kriyas to prepare themselves for the practice of Pranayama and their success comes in easily. These
six Kriyas are: 1. Dhauti, 2. Basti, 3. Neti, 4. Trataka, 5. Nauli and 6. Kapalabhati.

Take a clean piece of muslin cloth 4 fingers wide and 15 feet long. Dip it in tepid water. The
borders of the cloth should be nicely stitched on all sides and no pieces of thread should be hanging
loose. Then slowly swallow it and draw it out again. Swallow one foot the first day and increase it
daily, little by little. This is called Vastra-Dhauti. In the beginning you may have slight retching. It
stops on the third day. This practice cures diseases of the stomach, such as gastritis, Gulma
(dyspepsia), belching, fever, lumbago, asthma, Pleeha (diseases of spleen), leprosy, skin-diseases
and disorders of phlegm and bile. You need not practise it daily. You can practise it once a week or
once in a fortnight. Wash the cloth with soap and keep it always clean. Drink a cup of milk after the
practice is over; otherwise, you will feel a dry sensation inside.

This can be practised with or without a bamboo tube. But it is better to have a bamboo-tube.
Sit in a tub of water covering your navel. Assume the posture Utkatasana by resting your body on
the forepart of your feet, the heels pressing against the posteriors. Take a small bamboo-tube 6
fingers long and insert 4 fingers of its length into the anus after lubricating the tube with vaseline or
soap or castor oil. Then contract the anus. Draw the water into the bowels slowly. Shake well the
water within the bowels and then expel the water outside. It is known as Jala-Basti. It cures Pleeha,

Have a separate meditation room under lock and key. Never allow anyone to enter the room.
Keep it sacred. If you cannot afford to have a special room for contemplative purposes and for
practising Pranayama, have a place in the corner of a quiet room, set apart for this purpose. Have it
screened. Place the photo of your Guru or Ishta-Devata in the room in front of your Asana. Do Puja
daily to the picture, physically and mentally, before you start meditation and Pranayama. Burn
incense in the room or burn Agarbathi (incense sticks). Keep some sacred books there such as
Ramayana, Srimad Bhagavata, Gita, Upanishads, Yoga-Vasishtha, etc., for your daily study.
Spread a fourfold blanket and over it a piece of soft white cloth. This will serve the purpose of an
Asana. Or spread an Asana Of Kusa grass. Over it spread a deer or tiger skin. Sit on this Asana for
practising Pranayama and meditation. You can have a raised platform made of cement. Over this
you can spread your Asana. Small insects, ants, etc., will not molest you. When you sit on the Asana
keep your head, neck and trunk in a straight line. By doing so, the spinal cord that lies with the
spinal column will be quite free.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

The Five Essentials

Five things are necessary for practising Pranayama. First a good place; second, a suitable
time; third, moderate, substantial, light and nutritious food; fourth, patient and persistent practice
with zeal, ease and earnestness and lastly the purification of Nadis (Nadi-Suddhi). When the Nadis
are purified the aspirant enters the first stage in the practice of Yoga—‘Arambha’. A Pranayama
practitioner has a good appetite, good digestion, cheerfulness, courage, strength, vigour, a high
standard of vitality and a handsome appearance. The Yogi should take his food at a time when
Surya Nadi or Pingala is working, i.e., when the breath flows through the right nostril, because
Pingala is heating and digests the food quickly. Pranayama should not be practised just after taking
meals, nor when one is very hungry. Gradually one should be able to retain the breath for 3 Ghatikas
(one hour and a half) at a time. Through this, the Yogi gets many psychic powers. When anyone
wants to stop the breath for a long period, he should remain by the side of a Yogi Guru, who knows
the practice of Pranayama thoroughly. The breath can be suspended by graduated practice from one
to three minutes without the help of anybody. Suspension for three minutes is quite sufficient for
purifying the Nadis and steadying the mind and for the purpose of good health.

The Place

Select a solitary, beautiful and pleasant spot, where there are no disturbances; on the bank of
a river, lake or the sea or the top of a hill where there is a nice spring and grove of trees, and where
milk and articles of food are easily procurable. Build a small Kutir or hut. Have one compound. In
the corner of the enclosure, sink a well. It is impossible to get an ideal place that can satisfy you
from all viewpoints.

The banks of Narmada, Jamuna, Ganga, Kaveri, Godavari, Krishna are very suitable for
building Kutirs or huts. You must select one such spot, where there are some other Yogic
practitioners in the neighbourhood. You can consult them in times of difficulties. You will have
faith in the Yogic Kriyas. When you see others also who are devoted to such Yogic practices, you
will diligently apply yourself in your practice, as you will get an impetus and you will strive to excel
them. Nasik, Rishikesh, Jhansi, Prayag, Uttarkasi, Brindavan, Ayodhya, Varanasi, etc., are good
places. You can fix a spot in a place far from the crowded localities. If you build a Kutir in a
crowded place, people out of curiosity will molest you. You will have no spiritual vibrations there.
You will be without any protection if you build your cottage in a thick forest. Thieves and wild
animals will trouble you. The question of difficulty for food will arise. In Svetasvatara Upanishad it
is said: “At a level place, free from pebbles, fire and gravel; pleasant to the eyes, and repairing to a
cave, protected from the wind, let a person apply his mind to God.”

Those who practise in their own houses can convert a room into a forest. Any solitary room

will serve their purpose well.

The practice of Pranayama should be commenced in Vasanta Ritu (spring) or Sarad Ritu
(autumn) because in these seasons success is attained without any difficulty or troubles. The
Vasanta is the period from March to April. The Sarad, autumn, lasts from September to October. In

The Time

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

The Adhikari

(The Qualified Person)

One who has a calm mind, who has subdued his Indriyas, who has faith in the words of the
Guru and Sastras, who is an Astika (i.e., one who believes in God) and is moderate in eating,
drinking and sleeping and one who has an eager longing for deliverance from the wheel of births
and deaths—is an Adhikari (qualified person) for the practice of Yoga. Such a man can easily get
success in the practice. Pranayama should be practised with care, perseverance and faith.

Those who are addicted to sensual pleasures or those who are arrogant, dishonest,
untruthful, diplomatic, cunning and treacherous; those who disrespect Sadhus, Sannyasins and
their Gurus or spiritual preceptors and take pleasure in vain controversies, or of a highly talkative
nature, those who are disbelievers, who mix much with worldly-minded people, who are cruel,
harsh and greedy and do much useless Vyavahara (worldly activities), can never attain success in
Pranayama or any other Yogic practice.

There are three types of Adhikaris, viz., 1. good (Uttama), 2. middle (Madhyama) and 3.
intelligence, degree of Vairagya, Viveka and

inferior (Adhama) according to Samskaras,
Mumukshutva and the capacity for Sadhana.

You must approach a Guru, who knows Yogasastra and has mastery over it. Sit at his
lotus-feet. Serve him. Clear your doubts through sensible and reasonable questions. Receive
instructions and practise them with enthusiasm, zeal, attention, earnestness and faith according to
the methods taught by the teacher.

A Pranayama practitioner should always speak kind and sweet words. He must be kind to
everybody. He must be honest. He must speak the truth. He must develop Vairagya, patience,
Sraddha (faith), Bhakti (devotion), Karuna (mercy), etc. He must observe perfect celibacy. A
householder should be very moderate in sexual matters during the practice.

Dietetic Discipline

The proficient in Yoga should abandon articles of food, detrimental to the practice of Yoga.
He should give up salt, mustard, sour, hot, pungent and bitter things, asafoetida, worship of fire,
women, too much walking, bathing at sunrise, emaciation of the body by fasts, etc. During the early
stages of practice food of milk and ghee is ordained; also food consisting of wheat, green pulse and
red rice is said to favour the progress. Then he will be able to retain his breath as long as he likes. By
thus retaining the breath as long as he likes Kevala Kumbhaka (cessation of breath without
inspiration and expiration) is attained. When Kevala Kumbhaka is attained by one, expiration and
inspiration are dispensed with. There is nothing unattainable in the three worlds for him. In the
commencement of his practice sweat is getting out. As a frog moves by leaps so the Yogi sitting in
Padmasana moves on the earth. With a further increased practice, he is able to rise from the ground.

16

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

He, while seated in lotus-posture, levitates. Then arise in him the power to perform extraordinary
feats. Any pain, small or great, does not affect the Yogi. Then excretions and sleep are diminished;
tears, rheum in the eyes, salivary flow, sweat and bad smell in the mouth, do not arise in him. With a
still further practice, he acquires great strength by which he attains Bhuchara Siddhi which enables
him to bring under his control all the creatures that tread on this earth; tigers, Sarabhas, elephants,
wild bulls and lions even die by a blow given by the palms of this Yogi. He becomes as beautiful as
the God of Love himself. By the preservation of the semen a good odour pervades the body of the
Yogi.

Instinct or voice within will guide you in the selection of articles of diet. You are yourself
the best judge to form a Sattvic Yogic menu to suit your temperament and constitution. Further
information is given in the Appendix.

Take wholesome Sattvic food half stomachful. Fill a quarter with pure water. Allow the

remaining quarter free for expansion of gas and for propitiating the Lord.

You must not practise Pranayama just after meals. When you are very hungry, then also you
must not practise. Go to the water closet and empty the bowels before you begin Pranayama. A
Pranayama-practitioner should observe Samyama (control) in food and drink.

Those who are-strict and regular in diet derive immense benefits during the course of
practice. They get success quickly. Those persons who suffer from chronic constipation and who
are in the habit of defecating in the afternoon can practise Pranayama in the early morning without
answering the calls of nature. They should try their level best by some means or other to get an
evacuation of their bowels in the early morning.

Food plays a very important role in Yoga Sadhana. An aspirant should be very, very careful
in the selection of articles of diet, in the beginning of his Sadhana period. Later on when
Pranayama-Siddhi is obtained drastic dietetic restrictions can be removed.

This is a mixture of boiled, white rice, ghee, sugar and milk. This is a wholesome

combination for Brahmacharins and Pranayama-practitioners.

Charu

17

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Milk Diet

Milk should be scalded but not too much boiled. The process of scalding is that the milk
should be immediately removed from the fire as soon as the boiling point is reached. Too much
boiling destroys the vitamins, the mysterious nutritive principles and renders it quite useless as an
article of diet. Milk is a perfect food by itself, containing as it does, the different nutritive
constituents in a well-balanced proportion. It leaves very little residue in the bowels. This is an ideal
food for Yogic students during Pranayama practice.

Fruit Diet

A fruit diet exercises a benign, soothing influence on the constitution and is a very desirable
diet for Yogins. This is a natural form of diet. Fruits are very great energy-producers. Bananas,
grapes, sweet oranges, apples, pomegranates, mangoes, Chikkus (Sappota) and dates are
wholesome fruits. Lemons possess anti-scorbutic properties and act as restoratives to blood.
Fruit-juice contains vitamin C. Chikkus increase pure blood. Mangoes and milk is a healthy
agreeable combination. You can live on mangoes and milk alone. Pomegranate juice is cooling and
very nutritious. Bananas are very nutritious and substantial. Fruits help concentration and easy
mental focussing.

Articles Allowed

Barley, wheat, ghee, milk, almonds promote longevity and increase power and strength.
Barley is a fine article of diet for a Yogi and Sadhaka. It is cooling too. Sri Swami Narayan, the
author of ‘Ek Santka Anubhav’, who wears a Kaupin of gunny bag, lives on bread, made up of
barley. He recommends barley bread to his disciples. It is said that Emperor Akbar lived upon
barley.

You can take wheat, rice, barley, milk, bread, cow’s milk, ghee, sugar, butter, sugar-candy,
honey, dried ginger (Soont), green pulse, Moongdal, Panchashaka vegetables, Peypudalai,
potatoes, raisins, dates, light Khichdi of green dal. Khichdi is a light food and can be agreeably
taken. The food should be reduced in proportion to the increase in Kumbhaka. You must not reduce
your food much, in the beginning of your practice. You must use your commonsense, all throughout
the Sadhana. Toor-ki-dal can be taken. The Pancha-Shaka belongs to the species of spinach. They
are excellent vegetables; the thick succulent young leaves are boiled and seasoned or fried with
ghee. They are five in number, viz., Seendil, Chakravarthi, Ponnangani, Chirukeerai and
Valloicharnai keerai. When the Pingala or Suryanadi runs in the right nostril, you must take your
food. Suryanadi produces heat. It will digest the food well. You may take jack-fruit, cucumber,
brinjal, plantain-stem, Lauki Parval and Bhindi (lady’s finger).

Articles Forbidden

Highly seasoned dishes, hot curries, chutnies, meat, fishes, chillies, sour articles, tamarind,
mustard, all kinds of oil, asafoetida, salt, garlic, onions, urad-ki-dal (black gram), all bitter things,
dry foods, black sugar, vinegar, alcohol, sour curd, stale foods, acids, astringents, pungent stuff,
roasted things, heavy vegetables, over-ripe or unripe fruits, pumpkins, etc., must be avoided. Meat

18

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

can make man a scientist, but rarely a Philosopher, Yogi or a Tattva Jnani. Onions and garlic are
worse than meat. All food-stuffs contain a small quantity of salt. So, even if you do not add salt
separately, the system will derive the necessary quantity of salt from other food-stuffs. The giving
up of salt will not produce deficiency of hydrochloric acid and dyspepsia as allopathic doctors
foolishly imagine. Salt excites passion. No ill-effects are produced by the giving up of salt.
Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Yogananda had given up salt for over thirteen years. Giving up salt
helps you in controlling the tongue and thereby the mind also and in developing will-power too.
You will have good health. Sitting before fire, company of women and worldly-minded people,
Yatra, long walk, carrying heavy burdens, cold bath in the early morning, harsh words, speaking
untruth, dishonest practices, theft, killing animals, Himsa of all kinds either in thought, word or
deed, hatred and enmity towards any person, fighting, quarrelling, pride, double-dealing,
intriguing, back-biting, tale-bearing, crookedness, talks other than those of Atman and Moksha,
cruelty towards animals and men, too much fasting or eating only once every day, etc., are not
allowed for a Pranayama-practitioner.

A Kutir For Sadhana

The Pranayama student should erect a beautiful room or Kutir with a very small opening
and with no crevices. It should be well pasted with cowdung or with white cement. It should be
absolutely free from bugs, mosquitoes and lice. It should be swept well everyday, with a broom. It
should be perfumed with good odour and fragrant resin should be burnt therein. Having taken his
seat, neither too high nor too low, on an Asana, made of a cloth, deer-skin and Kusha grass one over
the other, a wise man should assume the lotus-posture and keeping his body erect and his hands
folded in respect should salute his tutelary deity and Sri Ganesa by repeating ‘Om Sri Ganesaya
Namah’. Then he should begin to practise Pranayama.

The time taken in making a round of the palm of the hand, neither very slow nor quickly

snapping the fingers once, is called Matra.

Each time-unit is called Matra. The twinkling of an eye is sometimes taken as the period of
one Matra. Time occupied by one normal respiration is considered as one Matra. Time taken up in
pronouncing the mono-syllable, OM, is regarded as one Matra. This is very convenient. Many
Pranayama-practitioners adopt this time-unit in their practice.

Padmasana (Lotus Pose)

This is also known by the name Kamalasana. Kamala means lotus. When the Asana is

demonstrated it presents the appearance of a lotus in a way. Hence the name Padmasana.

Amongst the four poses prescribed for Japa and Dhyana, Padmasana comes foremost. It is
the best Asana for contemplation. Rishis like Gheranda, Sandilya, speak very highly of this
important Asana. This is highly agreeable for householders. Even ladies can sit in this Asana.
Padmasana is suitable for lean persons and for youths as well.

Matra

19

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Sit on the ground by spreading the legs forward. Then place the right foot on the left thigh
and the left foot on the right thigh. Place the hands on the knee-joints. You can make a finger-lock
and keep the locked hands over the left ankle. This is very convenient for some persons. Or you can
place the left hand over the left knee and the right hand over the right knee with the palm facing
upwards and the index finger touching the middle portion of the thumb (Chinmudra).

Siddhasana (The Perfect Pose)

Next to Padmasana comes Siddhasana in importance. Some eulogise this Asana as even
superior to Padmasana for the purpose of Dhyana (contemplation). If you get mastery over this
Asana you will acquire many Siddhis. Further, it was being practised by many Siddhas (perfected
Yogins) of yore. Hence the name Siddhasana.

Even fatty persons with big thighs can practise this Asana daily. In fact this is better for
some persons than Padmasana. Young Brahmacharins, who attempt to get established in celibacy,
should practise this Asana. This is not suitable for ladies.

Svastika is sitting at ease with the body erect. Spread the legs forward. Fold the left leg and
place the foot near the right thigh muscles. Similarly, bend the right leg and push the foot in the
space between the thigh and calf muscles. Now you will find the feet between the thighs and calves
of the legs. This is very comfortable for meditation. Keep the hands as instructed in Padmasana.

Samasana (Equal Pose)

Three Bandhas

Place the left heel at the beginning of the right thigh and the right heel at the beginning of the

left thigh. Sit at ease. Do not bend either on the left or right. This is called as Samasana.

There are four Bhedas (piercing of divisions) viz., Surya, Ujjayi, Sitali and Basti. Through
these four ways, when Kumbhaka is near or about to be performed, the sinless Yogi should practise
the three Bandhas. The first is called Mula Bandha. The second is called Uddiyana, and the third is
Jalandhara. Their nature will be thus described. Apana which has a downward tendency is forced up
by contracting and drawing the anus upwards. This process is called Mula Bandha. When Apana is
raised up and reaches the sphere of Agni (fire), then the flame of Agni grows long, being blown
about by Vayu. The Agni and Apana come to or commingle with Prana in a heated state. Through
this Agni, which is very fiery arises in the body the flaming of fire which rouses the sleeping
Kundalini. Then the Kundalini makes a hissing noise, becomes erect like a serpent beaten with a
stick and enters into the hole of Brahmanadi (Sushumna). Therefore Yogins should daily practise
Mula Bandha. Uddiyana should be performed at the end of Kumbhaka and at the beginning of
inhalation. Because Prana ‘Uddiyate’—goes up the Sushumna in this Bandha, it is called Uddiyana
by the Yogins. Being seated in the Vajra posture and holding firmly the two toes by the two hands
near the two ankles, he should gradually upbear the Tana (thread or Nadi, the Sarasvati Nadi) which
is on the western side of Udara (the upper part of the abdomen, above the navel), then to neck. When

22

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Prana reaches Sandhi (junction) of navel, slowly it removes the diseases of the navel. Therefore this
should be practised perfectly. Uddiyana can be done in standing posture also. When you practise in
standing posture, place your hands on the knees or a little above the knees. Keep the legs a little
apart.

The Bandha called Jalandhara should be practised at the end of Puraka. Jalandhara is of the
form of contraction of the neck and is an impediment to the passage of Vayu upwards. When the
neck is contracted by bending the head downwards, so that the chin may touch the chest, Prana goes
through Brahmanadi. Assuming the seat, as mentioned before, one should stir up Sarasvati and
control Prana. On the first day Kumbhaka should be done four times, on the second day ten times
and then five times separately. On the third day, twenty times will do and afterwards Kumbhaka
should be performed with the Bandhas and with an increase of two times per day.

Arambha Avastha

Pranava (!) should be chanted with three Matras (prolonged intonations). This is for the
destruction of the former sins. The Mantra, Pranava, destroys all obstacles and all sins. By
practising this he attains the ‘Arambha Avastha’ (the beginning or first stage). The body of the Yogi
begins to perspire. When it perspires he should rub it well with the hands. The trembling of the body
also occurs. He sometimes jumps like a frog.

Ghata Avastha

Then follows the Ghata Avastha, the second state, which is acquired by constantly
practising suppression of breath. When a perfect union takes place between Prana and Apana,
Manas and Buddhi or Jivatman and Paramatman without opposition, it is called Ghata Avastha. He
may now practise only for about one-fourth of the period prescribed for the practice before. By day
and by evening let him practise only for a Yama (3 hours). Let him practise the Kevala Kumbhaka
once a day. Drawing away completely the organs from the objects of senses during cessation of
breath is called Pratyahara. Whatever he sees with his eyes, let him consider as Atman. Whatever he
hears with his ears, let him consider as Atman. Whatever he smells with his nose, let him consider
as Atman. Whatever he tastes with his tongue, let him consider as Atman. Whatever the Yogi
touches with his skin, let him consider as Atman. Then various wonderful powers are obtained by
the Yogi, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, ability to transport himself to great distances within a
moment, great power of speech, ability to take up any form he likes, ability to become invisible and
the wonder of transmuting iron into gold.

That Yogi who is carefully practising Yoga, attains the power to levitate. Then, should the
wise Yogi think that these powers are great obstacles in the attainment of Yoga, he should never
take delight or recourse to them. The Yogins should not exercise these powers before any person
whomsoever. He should live in the world as an ordinary man in order to keep his powers concealed.
His disciples would, without doubt, request him to show them (his powers) for the gratification of
their desire. One, who is actively engaged in one’s (world-imposed) duties, forgets to practise
Yoga. So he should practise day and night nothing but Yoga without forgetting the words of his
Guru. Thus he who is constantly engaged in Yogic practices, passes the Ghata state. Nothing is
gained by useless company of worldly-minded people. Therefore, one should with great effort shun
evil company and practise Yoga.

Parichaya Avastha

Then by such constant practice, the Parichaya Avastha (the third state) is gained. Vayu or
breath, through arduous practice pierces the Kundalini, along with Agni through thought and enters
the Sushumna, uninterrupted. When one’s Chitta enters the Sushumna along with Prana, it reaches
the high seat in the head, along with Prana. When the Yogi by the practice of Yoga acquires power
of action (Kriya Sakti) and pierces through the Six Chakras and reaches the secure condition of
Parichaya, the Yogi then verily sees the threefold effects of Karma. Then let the Yogi destroy the
multitude of Karmas by the Pranava (!). Let him accomplish ‘Kaya-Vyuha’, a mystical process of
arranging the various Skandhas of the body and taking various bodies, in order to exhaust all his

25

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

previous Karmas without the necessity of being reborn. At that time let the great Yogi practise the
five Dharanas* or forms of concentration by which, command over the five elements is gained and
fear of injuries by any one of them is removed.

Nishpatti Avastha

This is the fourth stage of Pranayama. Through graduated practice the Yogi reaches the
Nishpatti Avastha, the state of consummation. The Yogi, having destroyed all the seeds of Karma
drinks the nectar of immortality. He feels neither hunger nor thirst, nor sleep nor swoon. He
becomes absolutely independent. He can move anywhere in the world. He is never reborn. He is
free from all diseases, decay and old age. He enjoys the bliss of Samadhi. He is no longer in need of
any Yogic practice. When the skilful tranquil Yogi can drink the Prana Vayu by placing his tongue
at the root of the palate, when he knows the laws of action of Prana and Apana, then he becomes
entitled to liberation.

A Yogic student will automatically experience all these Avasthas one by one as he advances
in his systematic, regular practices. An impatient student cannot experience any of these Avasthas
through occasional practices. Care should be taken in the observances of Mitahara and
Brahmacharya.

Chapter Three

What is Pranayama

Tasmin sati svasaprasvasayor-gativicchedah pranayamah—“Regulation of breath or the
control of Prana is the stoppage of inhalation and exhalation, which follows after securing that
steadiness of posture or seat.”

This is the definition of Pranayama in the Yoga-sutras of Patanjali.

‘Svasa’ means inspiratory breath. ‘Prasvasa’ means expiratory breath. You can take up the
practice of Pranayama after you have gained steadiness in your Asana (seat). If you can sit for 3
hour in one Asana, continuously at one stretch, you have gained mastery over the Asana. If you are
able to sit from half to one hour even, you can take up the practice of Pranayama. You can hardly
make any spiritual progress without the practice of Pranayama.

Prana is Vyashti, when the individual is concerned. The sum total of the cosmic energy or
cosmic Prana is Hiranyagarbha who is known as the floating ‘Golden-Egg’. Hiranyagarbha is
Samashti Prana. One match stick is Vyashti (single). The whole match box is Samashti. A single
mango-tree is Vyashti. The whole mango grove is Samashti. The energy in the body is Prana. By
controlling the motion of the lungs or respiratory organs, we can control the Prana that is vibrating

*

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

inside. By control of Prana, the mind can be easily controlled, because the mind is fastened to the
Prana, like the bird to the string. Just as the bird that is tied to a post by a string, after flying here and
there, finds its resting place in the post, so also this mind-bird after running hither and thither, in
various sensual objects, finds its resting place during deep sleep in the Prana.

Pranayama (According to the Gita)

Apane

juhvati

pranam pranepanam tathapare;

ruddhva
pranayamaparayanah (Gita, Ch. IV-29.). Others offer Prana (outgoing breath) in Apana (incoming
breath) and Apana in Prana, restraining the passage of Prana and Apana, absorbed in Pranayama.
Pranayama is a precious Yajna (sacrifice). Some practise the kind of Pranayama called Puraka
(filling in). Some practise the kind of Pranayama called Rechaka (emptying). Some are engaged in
the practice of Pranayama called Kumbhaka, by impeding the outward passage of air, through the
nostrils and the mouth, and by impeding the inward passage of the air, in the opposite direction.

Pranapanagatee

Pranayama (According To Sri Sankaracharya)

“Pranayama is the control of all life-forces by realising naught but Brahman in all things as

the mind, etc.

called the incoming breath.

“The negation of the Universe is the outgoing breath. The thought: ‘I am Brahman’ itself is

The permanence of that thought thereafter is the restrained breath. This is the Pranayama of

the wise, while the pressing of the nose is only for the unknowing.” (Aparokshanubhuti, 118-120).

Pranayama (According to Yogi Bhusunda)

Bhusunda says to Sri Vasishtha: “In the cool lotus of the heart within this visible tenement
of flesh composed of the five elements, there are two Vayus, viz., Prana and Apana, commingled in
it. For those who tread smoothly and without any or the slightest efforts, the path of these two
Vayus, will become the sun and the moon themselves in the heart—Akasa, and will rove in the
Akasa and yet be animating and carrying their fleshy-tabernacle. These Vayus will go up and down
to higher and lower states. They are of the same nature in the waking, dreaming and dreamless
sleeping state, and permeate all throughout. I am moving in the direction of those two Vayus and
have rendered nil all my Vasanas in the waking state lit unto those of the dreamless sleeping state.
Divide a filament of the lotus-stalk into a thousand times and you will find these Vayus more subtle
than that. Hence it is difficult for me to treat about the nature of these Vayus and their vibrations. Of
these, Prana does ceaselessly vibrate in this body, with an upward motion, both externally and
internally, while Apana having the same fluctuating tendency, vibrates both external and internal to
the body having a downward motion. It will be beneficial if the Prana exhaled to the extent of 16
digits, is inhaled to the same extent. Only 12 digits are inhaled ordinarily. Those who have brought
to experience—viz., the equalisation of Prana in exhalation and inhalation will enjoy infinite bliss.

“Now hear about the characteristics of Prana. The inhalation to the length of 12 digits of the
Prana which has been exhaled, is called (the internal) Puraka (inhalation). This also is called the

27

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

internal (Puraka), when Apana Vayu re-enters the body from outside without any effort. When
Apana Vayu ceases to manifest itself and Prana gets absorbed in the heart, then the time occupied in
such a state is (internal) Kumbha. Yogins are able to experience all these. When the Prana in the
Akasa of the heart manifests itself externally (to the heart within) in diverse aspects without any
affliction to the mind then it is called (the external) Rechaka (exhalation). When the externally
fluctuating Prana enters the nose and stops there at its tip, then it is called the external Puraka. But
when it is passing from the tip of the nose it goes down 12 digits. Then also it is called the external
Puraka. When Prana goes arrested without and Apana within, then it is called the external
Kumbhaka. When the shining Apana Vayu takes an upward bent within, then it is styled the
external Rechaka. All these practices lead to Moksha. Therefore they should ever be meditated
upon. Those who have understood and practised well all the external and internal Kumbhakas and
others, will never be reborn.

“All the eight courses, I have given out before, are capable of yielding Moksha. They should
be practised both day and night. Those who are associated with these practices smoothly and
control their minds by not letting them run in other directions, will in course of time attain Nirvana.
Such practitioners will never thirst after material pleasures. They will ever be in their uniform
practice, whether walking, standing, waking, dreaming or sleeping.

“Prana, having flown out, will again be absorbed in the heart having run back 12 digits.
Similarly will Apana be absorbed in the heart, having issued out of the heart and running back 12
digits to it. Apana being the moon, will cool the whole body in its passage. But Prana being the sun,
will generate heat in the system and cook or digest everything in it. Will pains arise in one who has
reached that supreme state, where the Kalas (rays) of Apana the moon, are drowned by Prana the
sun? Will rebirth arise in one who has reached that powerful seat, when the Kalas of Prana, the sun,
are devoured by Apana the moon? These will arrest at once the seven births of those who reach that
neutral state where they find Apana Vayu consumed by Prana and vice versa. I eulogise that
Chidatma, who is in that intermediate state, where Prana and Apana are absorbed in one another. I
meditate ceaselessly upon that Chidatma, who is in the Akasa, directly in front, at the end of my
nose, where Prana and Apana both become extinct. Thus it is through this path of Prana’s control,
that I attained the supreme and immaculate Tattva, devoid of pains.”

Control of Breath

The first important step is to master the Asana of posture or to control the body. The next
exercise is Pranayama. Correct posture is indispensably requisite for the successful practice of
Pranayama. An easy comfortable posture is Asana. That pose is the best which continues to be
comfortable for the greatest length of time. Chest, neck, and head must be in one vertical line. You
should not bend the body either forwards or laterally, i.e., either on the right or left side. You should
not sit crooked. You should not allow the body to collapse. You must not bend the body either
forwards or backwards. By regular practice the mastery over the pose will come by itself. Fatty
people will find it difficult to practise the Padma Asana or the Lotus Pose. They can sit on the Sukha
Asana (comfortable pose) or Siddha Asana (perfected pose). You need not wait for practising
Pranayama till you get full mastery over the Asana. Practise Asana and side by side you can practise
Pranayama also. In course of time, you will acquire perfection in both. Pranayama can also be
practised by sitting in the chair erect.

28

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

In Bhagavad-Gita, the Immortal Song of Lord Krishna, you will find a beautiful description
of seat and pose: “In a pure secret place by himself established in a fixed seat of his own, neither too
high nor too low, with cloth, black antelope-skin and Kusa grass one over the other, there, making
the mind one-pointed, with thought and the functions of the senses controlled, steady on his seat, he
should practise Yoga for the purification of the Self, holding the body, head and neck erect, firm,
gazing steadily at the tip of the nose without looking around” (Ch. VI—10,11, & 12).

Pranayama is the control of the Prana and the vital forces of the body. It is regulation of the
breath. This is the most important step. The aim of Pranayama is the control of Prana. Pranayama
begins with the regulation of the breath for having control over the life-currents or inner vital force.
In other words, Pranayama is the perfect control of the life-currents through control of breath.
Breath is external manifestation of the gross Prana. A correct habit of breathing must be established
by the regular practice of Pranayama. In ordinary worldly persons the breathing is irregular.

If you can control the Prana you can completely control all the forces of the Universe,
mental and physical. The Yogi can also control the Omnipresent manifesting power out of which all
energies take their origin, whether concerning magnetism, electricity, gravitation, cohesion,
nerve-currents, vital forces or thought-vibrations, in fact the total forces of the Universe, physical
and mental.

If one controls the breath or Prana, the mind also is controlled. He who has controlled his
mind has also controlled his breath. If one is suspended, the other is also suspended. If the mind and
Prana are both controlled one gets liberation from the round of births and deaths and attains
immortality. There is intimate connection between the mind, Prana and semen. If one controls the
seminal energy, the mind and Prana are also controlled. He who has controlled his seminal energy
has also controlled his Prana and mind.

He who practises Pranayama will have good appetite, cheerfulness, handsome figure, good
strength, courage, enthusiasm, a high standard of health, vigour and vitality and good concentration
of mind. Pranayama is quite suitable for the Westerners also. A Yogi measures the span of his life
not by the number of years but by the number of his breaths. You can take in a certain amount of
energy or Prana from the atmospheric air along with each breath. Vital capacity is the capacity
shown by the largest quantity of air a man can inhale after the deepest possible exhalation. A man
takes fifteen breaths in a minute. The total number of breaths comes to 21,600 times per day.

Varieties of Pranayama

“Bahya-abhyantar-stambha-vritti-desaa-kala
Sankhyabhih patidtishto deergha-sukshmah.”

Yoga Sutras—Chap. II, Sa. 50

Pranayama is regarded lengthy or subtle according to its three components, the external, the
internal and the steady; the retention processes are modified by the regulations of space, time and
number.

29

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

When the breath is expired, it is Rechaka, the first kind of Pranayama. When the breath is
drawn in, it is the second, termed Puraka. When it is suspended, it is the third kind, called
Kumbhaka. Kumbhaka is retention of breath. Kumbhaka increases the period of life. It augments
the inner spiritual force, vigour and vitality. If you retain the breath for one minute, this one minute
is added to your span of life. Yogins by taking the breath to the Brahmarandhra at the top of the head
and keeping it there, defeat the Lord of death, Yama, and conquer death. Chang Dev lived for one
thousand and four hundred years through the practice of Kumbhaka. Each of these motions in
Pranayama, viz., Rechaka, Puraka and Kumbhaka, is regulated by space, time and number. By
space is meant the inside or outside of the body and the particular length or the breadth and also
when the Prana is held in some particular part of the body. During expiration the distance to which
breath is thrown outside varies in different individuals. The distance varies during inspiration also.
The length of the breath varies in accordance with the pervading Tattva. The length of the breath is
respectively 12, 16, 4, 8, 0 fingers’ breadths according to the Tattvas—Prithvi, Apas, Tejas, Vayu
or Akasa (earth, water, fire, air or ether). This is again external during exhalation and internal
during inhalation.

Time is, the time of duration of each of these, which is generally counted by Matra, which
corresponds to one second. Matra means a measure. By time is also meant how long the Prana
should be fixed in a particular centre or part.

Number refers to the number of times the Pranayama is performed. The Yogic student
should slowly take the number of Pranayamas to eighty at one sitting. He should have four sittings
in the morning, afternoon, evening and midnight, or at 9 a.m., and should have thus 320
Pranayamas in all. The effect or fruit of Pranayama is Udghata or awakening of the sleeping
Kundalini. The chief aim of Pranayama is to unite the Prana with the Apana and take the united
Pranayama slowly upwards towards the head.

Kundalini is the source for all occult powers. The Pranayama is long or short according to
the period of time, it is practised. Just as water, thrown on a hot pan shrivels upon all sides as it is
being dried up, so also air, moving in or out ceases its action by a strong effort of restraint
(Kumbhaka) and stays within.

Vachaspati describes—“Measured by 36 Matras, is the first attempt (Udghata), which is
mild. Twice that is the second, which is middling. Thrice that is the third, which is the intense. This
is the Pranayama as measured by number.”

The ‘place’ of exhalation lies within 12 Angulas (inches) of the tip of nose. This is to be
ascertained through a piece of reed or cotton. The place of inhalation ranges from the head down to
the soles of the feet. This is to be ascertained through a sensation similar to the touch of an ant. The
place of Kumbhaka consists of the external and internal places of both exhalation and inhalation
taken together, because the functions of the breath are capable of being held up at both these places.
This is to be ascertained through the absence of the two indicatives noted above, in connection with
exhalation and inhalation.

The specification of the three kinds of breath regulations, by all these three—time, space
and number—is only optional. They are not to be understood as to be practised collectively, for in

30

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

many Smritis we meet with passages, where the only specification mentioned with reference to the
regulation of breath is that of time.

The fourth is restraining the Prana by directing it

to external or internal object;

“Bahyabhyantara-vishayakshepi chaturthah” (Yoga Sutras: 11,50).

The third kind of Pranayama that is described in Sutra 50 of the Yoga Sutras, is practised
only till the first Udghata is marked. This fourth Pranayama is carried further. It concerns with the
fixing of the Prana in the various lotuses (Padmas or Chakras) and taking it slowly, and slowly, step
by step, and stage by stage to the last lotus in the head, where perfect Samadhi takes place. This is
internal. Externally it takes into consideration the length of breath in accordance with the prevailing
Tattva. Prana can be described either inside or outside.

By gradual mastery over the preliminary three kinds of Pranayama, the fourth kind comes
in. In the third kind of Pranayama the sphere is not taken into consideration. The stoppage of the
breath occurs with one single effort and is then measured by space, time and number and thus
becomes Dirgha (long) and Sukshma (subtle). In the fourth variety, however the spheres of
expiration and inspiration are ascertained. The different states are mastered by and by. The fourth
variety is not practised all at once by a single effort like the third one. On the other hand, it reaches
different states of perfection, as it is being done. After one stage is mastered, the next stage is taken
up and practised. Then it goes in succession. The third is not preceded by measurements and is
brought about by a single effort. The fourth is however preceded by the knowledge of the
measurements, and is brought about by much effort. This is the only difference. The conditions of
time, space and number are applicable to this kind of Pranayama also. Particular occult powers
develop themselves at each stage of progress.

Three Types of Pranayama

There are three types of Pranayama, viz., Adhama, Madhyama and Uttama (inferior, middle
and superior). The Adhama Pranayama consists of 12 Matras, Madhyama consists of 24 Matras and
the Uttama occupies a time of 32 Matras. This is for Puraka. The ratio between Puraka, Kumbhaka
and Rechaka is 1:4:2. Puraka is inhalation. Kumbhaka is retention. Rechaka is exhalation. If you
inhale for a period of 12 Matras you will have to make Kumbhaka for a period of 48 Matras. Then
the time for Rechaka will be 24 Matras. This is for Adhama Pranayama. The same rule will apply to
the other two varieties. First, practise for a month of Adhama Pranayama. Then practise Madhyama
for three months. Then take up the Uttama variety.

Salute your Guru and Sri Ganesa as soon as you sit in the Asana. The time for Abhyasa is
early morning 4 a.m., 10 a.m., evening 4 p.m., and night 10 p.m., or 12 p.m. As you advance in
practice you will have to do 320 Pranayamas daily.

Sagarbha Pranayama is that Pranayama, which is attended with mental Japa of any Mantra,
either Gayatri or Om. It is one hundred times more powerful than the Agarbha Pranayama, which is
plain and unattended with any Japa. Pranayama Siddhi depends upon the intensity of the efforts of
the practitioner. An ardent enthusiastic student, with Parama Utsaha, Sahasa and Dridhata (zeal,
cheerfulness and tenacity), can effect Siddhi
(perfection) within six months; while a

31

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

happy-go-lucky practitioner with Tandri and Alasya (drowsiness and laziness) will find no
improvement even after eight or ten years. Plod on. Persevere with patience, faith, confidence,
expectation, interest and attention. You are bound to succeed. Nil desperandum—Never despair.

The Vedantic Kumbhaka

Being without any distraction and with a calm mind, one should practise Pranayama. Both
expiration and inspiration should be stopped. The practitioner should depend solely on Brahman;
that is the highest aim of life. The giving out of all external objects, is said to be Rechaka. The taking
in of the spiritual knowledge of Sastras, is said to be Puraka, and the keeping to oneself of such
knowledge is said to be Kumbhaka. He is an emancipated person who practises his Chitta thus.
There is no doubt about it. Through Kumbhaka the mind should always be taken up and through
Kumbhaka alone it should be filled up within. It is only through Kumbhaka that Kumbhaka should
be firmly mastered. Within it, is ‘Parama Siva’. At first in his Brahmagranthi there is produced soon
a hole or passage. Then having pierced Brahmagranthi, he pierces Vishnugranthi, then he pierces
Rudragranthi, then the Yogin attains his liberation through the religious ceremonies, performed in
various births, through the grace of Gurus and Devatas and through the practice of Yoga.

Pranayama for Nadi-Suddhi

The Vayu cannot enter the Nadis if they are full of impurities. Therefore, first of all, they
should be purified and then Pranayama should be practised. The Nadis are purified by two
processes, viz., Samanu and Nirmanu. The Samanu is done by a mental process with Bija Mantra.
The Nirmanu is done by physical cleansing or the Shatkarmas.

1. Sit on Padmasana. Meditate on the Bijakshara of Vayu y:(cid:246) (Yam) which is of smoke
colour. Inhale through the left nostril. Repeat the Bijakshara 16 times. This is Puraka. Retain the
breath till you repeat the Bija 64 times. This is Kumbhaka. Then exhale through the right nostril
very very slowly till you repeat the Bijakshara 32 times.

2. The navel is the seat of Agnitattva. Meditate on this Agnitattva. Then draw the breath
through the right nostril repeating 16 times the Agni Bija r(cid:246) (Ram). Retain the breath, till you count
the Bija 64 times. Then exhale slowly through the left nostril till you repeat mentally the Bija letter
32 times.

3. Fix the gaze at the tip of the nose. Inhale through the left nostril repeating the Bija Y(cid:246)
(Tham) 16 times. Retain the breath till you repeat the Bija (Tham) 64 times. Now imagine that the
nectar that flows from the moon, runs through all the vessels of the body and purifies them. Then
exhale slowly through right nostril till you repeat the Prithvi Bija l:(cid:246) (Lam) 32 times.

The Nadis are purified nicely by the practice of the above three kinds of Pranayama by

sitting firmly in your usual posture.

32

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Mantra During Pranayama

The Mantra for repetition during the practice of Pranayama is laid down in the Isvara Gita:
“When the aspirant holding his breath repeats the Gayatri thrice, together with even Vyahritis in the
beginning, the Siras at the end and the Pranava, one at both ends of it, this is, what is called the
regulation of breath.”

Yogi Yajnavalkya, on the other hand, declares thus: “The upward breath and the downward
breath, having been restrained, regulation of breath is to be practised by means of the Pranava (!)
with due regard to the unit of measure of the Mantra.

This repetition of the Pranava alone, is meant for the Paramahamsa Sannyasins. It has been
declared in the Smritis, that ordinary contemplation is to be practised, through the inhalation and
other stages of breath-regulation at one’s navel, heart and forehead, with reference to the forms of
Brahma, Vishnu and Siva respectively. For the Paramahamsa however, the only object of
contemplation has been declared to be Brahman. “The self-controlled ascetic is to contemplate
upon the supreme Brahman, by means of the Pranava,” declares the Sruti.

Exercise No. 1

Sit on Padmasana. Close your eyes. Concentrate on Trikuti (the space between the two
eye-brows). Close the right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale slowly through the left nostril as
long as you can do it with comfort. Then exhale very very slowly through the same nostril. Do
twelve times. This is one round.

Then inhale through the right nostril by closing the left nostril with your right ring and little

fingers and exhale very slowly through the same nostril. Do twelve times. This is one round.

Do not make any sound during inhalation and exhalation. Repeat your Ishta Mantra during
the practice. In the second week of practice, do two rounds, in the third week, three rounds. Take
rest for two minutes when one round is over. If you take a few normal breaths, when one round is
over, that will give you sufficient rest and you will be fresh for the next round. There is no
Kumbhaka in this exercise. You can increase the number of rounds according to your strength and
capacity.

Inhale through both the nostrils slowly and gently. Do not retain the breath. Then exhale
slowly. Do 12 times. This will constitute one round. You can do 2 or 3 rounds according to your
capacity and strength and time at your disposal.

Sit on your Asana. Close the right nostril with your right thumb. Then inhale slowly through
your left nostril. Close the left nostril with your right ring and little fingers and open the right nostril
by removing the right thumb. Exhale very slowly through the right nostril. Then draw the air

through the right nostril as long as you can do it with comfort and exhale through the left nostril by
removing the right ring and little fingers. There is no Kumbhaka in this Pranayama. Repeat the
process 12 times. This will constitute one round.

Exercise No. 4

Meditate that the single letter, the Supreme light—Pranava or OM—is the origin or source
of the three letters A, U and M. Inhale the air through Ida or left nostril for the space of 16 Matras
(seconds), meditate on the letter ‘A’ during that time; retain the air for the space of 64 Matras,
meditate on the letter ‘U’ during the time; exhale through the right nostril for the space of 32 Matras
and meditate on the letter ‘M’ during that time. Practise this again and again in the above order.
Begin with 2 or 3 times and gradually increase the number to 20 or 30 times according to your
capacity and strength. To begin with, keep the ratio 1:4:2. Gradually increase the ratio to 16:64:32.

Deep Breathing Exercise

Each deep breathing consists of a very full inhalation, through the nose and a deep, steady

exhalation also, through the nose.

Inhale slowly as much as you can do. Exhale slowly as much as you can do. During

inhalation, observe the following rules:

1. Stand up. Place the hands on the hips, the elbows will be out and not forced backward.

Stand at ease.

2. Lengthen the chest straight upwards. Press the hip bones with the hands in downward

direction. A vacuum will be formed by this act and the air will rush in of its own accord.

3. Keep the nostrils wide open. Do not use the nose as a suction pump. It should serve as a
passive passage for both the inhaled and the exhaled air. Do not make any sound when you inhale
and exhale. Remember that correct breathing is noiseless.

4. Stretch the whole upper part of the trunk.

5. Do not arch the upper chest into a cramped position. Keep the abdomen naturally relaxed.

6. Do not bend the head far backwards. Do not draw the abdomen inwards. Do not force the

shoulders back. Lift the shoulders up.

During the exhalation observe the following rules carefully:

1. Allow the ribs and the whole upper part of the trunk to sink down gradually.

2. Draw the lower ribs and abdomen upwards—slowly.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

3. Do not bend the body too much forward. Arching of the chest should be avoided. Keep
the head, neck and trunk in a straight line. Contract the chest. Do not breathe the air out through the
mouth. Exhale very, very slowly without producing any noise.

4. Expiration simply takes place by relaxing the inspiratory muscles. The chest falls down

by its own weight and expels the air out through the nose.

5. In the beginning, do not retain the breath after inhalation. When the process of inhalation
is over begin exhalation at once. When you have sufficiently advanced in your practice, you can
slowly retain the breath from five seconds to one minute according to your capacity.

6. When one round of three deep breathings is over, you can take a little rest, ‘Respiratory
pause’—by taking a few normal breaths. Then start the second round. During the pause, stand still
in a comfortable position with hands on hips. The number of rounds can be fixed according to the
capacity of the practitioner. Do 3 or 4 rounds and increase one round every week. Deep breathing is
only a variety of Pranayama.

Kapalabhati

‘Kapala’ is a Sanskrit word; it means skull. ‘Bhati’ means to shine. The term ‘Kapalabhati’
means an exercise that makes the skull shine. This Kriya cleanses the skull. So this is taken as one of
the Shat-Karmas (six cleansing processes in Hatha Yoga).

Sit on Padmasana. Keep the hands on knees. Close the eyes. Perform Puraka and Rechaka
rapidly. This should be practised vigorously. One will get perspiration profusely. This is a good
form of exercise. Those who are well-versed in Kapalabhati, can do Bhastrika very easily. There is
no Kumbhaka in this Pranayama. Rechaka plays a prominent part. Puraka is mild, slow and long
(Dirgha). But the Rechaka should be done quickly and forcibly by contracting the abdominal
muscles with a backward push. When you do Puraka, release the abdominal muscles. Some people
naturally make a curve of the spine and bend their heads also. This is not desirable. The head and the
trunk should be erect. Sudden expulsions of breath follow one another as in Bhastrika. To start with,
you can have one expulsion per second. Gradually you can have two expulsions per second. To
begin with do one round in the morning consisting of 10 expulsions only. In the second week, do
one round in the evening. In the third week, do two rounds in the morning and two rounds in the
evening. Thus every week, gradually and cautiously increase 10 expulsions to each round till you
get 120 expulsions for each round.

It cleanses the respiratory system and the nasal passages. It removes the spasm in bronchial
tubes. Consequently, Asthma is relieved and also cured in course of time. The apices of the lungs
get proper oxygenation. Thereby they cannot afford favourable nidus (breeding grounds) for
tubercle bacilli. Consumption is cured by this practice. Lungs are considerably developed. Carbon
dioxide is eliminated in a large scale. Impurities of the blood are thrown out. Tissues and cells
absorb a large quantity of oxygen. The practitioner keeps up good health. Heart functions properly.
The circulatory and respiratory systems are toned to a considerable degree.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

The External Kumbhaka (Bahya)

Draw the air through the left nostril till you count 3 OMs; throw it out through the right
nostril immediately without retaining it counting 6 OMs. Stop it outside till you count 12 OMs.
Then draw the breath through the right; exhale it through the left and stop it outside as before, using
the same units of OM for inhalation, exhalation and retention. Do six times in the morning and six
times in the evening. Gradually increase the number of rounds and the time of Kumbhaka. Do not
strain or fatigue yourself.

Easy Comfortable Pranayama (Sukha Purvaka)

Sit on Padmasana or Siddhasana in your meditation room, before the picture of your Ishta
Devata (guiding deity). Close the right nostril with the right thumb. Draw in the air very, very
slowly through the left nostril. Then close the left nostril also with little and ring fingers of the right
hand. Retain the air as long as you can comfortably do. Then exhale very, very slowly through the
nostril after removing the thumb. Now half the process is over. Then draw air through the right
nostril. Retain the air as before and exhale it very, very slowly through the left nostril. All these six
processes constitute one Pranayama. Do 20 in the morning and 20 in the evening. Gradually
increase the number. Have a Bhava (mental attitude) that all the Daivi Sampat (divine qualities),
e.g., mercy, love, forgiveness, Santi, joy, etc., are entering into your system along with the inspired
air and all Asuri Sampat (devilish qualities) such as lust, anger, greed, etc., are being thrown out
along with the expired air. Repeat OM or Gayatri* mentally during Puraka, Kumbhaka and
Rechaka. Hard-working Sadhakas can do 320 Kumbhakas daily in four sittings at the rate of 80 in
each sitting.

This Pranayama removes all diseases, purifies the Nadis, steadies the mind in
concentration, improves digestion, increases the digestive fire and appetite, helps to maintain
Brahmacharya and awakens the Kundalini that is sleeping at the Muladhara Chakra. Purification of
Nadis will set in rapidly. You will have levitation (rising above the ground) also.

Pranayama for Awakening Kundalini

When you practise the following, concentrate on the Muladhara Chakra at the base of the
spinal column, which is triangular in form and which is the seat of the Kundalini Sakti. Close the
right nostril with your fight thumb. Inhale through the left nostril till you count 3 OMs slowly.
Imagine that you are drawing the Prana with the atmospheric air. Then close the left nostril with
your little and ring fingers of the right hand. Then retain the breath for 12 OMs. Send the current
down the spinal column straight into the triangular lotus, the Muladhara Chakra. Imagine that the
nerve-current is striking against the lotus and awakening the Kundalini. Then slowly exhale
through the right nostril counting 6 OMs. Repeat the process from the right nostril as stated above,
using the same units, and having the same imagination and feeling. This Pranayama will awaken
the Kundalini quickly. Do it 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. Increase the number

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

and time gradually and cautiously according to your strength and capacity. In this Pranayama,
concentration on the Muladhara Chakra is the important thing. Kundalini will be awakened quickly
if the degree of concentration is intense and if the Pranayama is practised regularly.

Pranayama During Meditation

If you do concentration and meditation, Pranayama, comes by itself. The breath becomes
slower and slower. We will practise this Pranayama daily unconsciously. When you are reading a
sensational storybook or when you are solving a mathematical problem, your mind is really very
much absorbed in the subject-matter. If you closely watch your breath on these occasions, you will
find that the breath has become very very slow. When you see a tragical story being enacted in the
theater or a film-show, when you hear a very sad striking news or some glad tidings, when you shed
tears either of joy or sorrow, or burst into laughter, the breath is slackened—Pranayama comes by
itself. In those Yogic students who practise Sirshasana, Pranayama comes by itself. It is obvious
from these examples that when the mind is deeply concentrated on any subject, the respiration
slows down or stops. Pranayama is being done automatically. Mind and Prana are intimately
connected. If you turn your attention to watch the breath on those occasions, it will regain its normal
state. Pranayama comes by itself to those who are deeply absorbed in doing Japa, Dhyana or
Brahma-Vichara (enquiry of Atman).

Prana, mind and Virya (seminal energy) are under one Sambandha (connection). If you can
control the mind, Prana and Virya are controlled by themselves. If you can control Prana, mind and
Virya are controlled by themselves. If you control the Virya by remaining as an Akhanda
Brahmachari without emission of even a single drop of semen for 12 years, mind and Prana are
controlled by themselves. Just as there is connection between wind and fire (light), so also there is
connection between Prana and mind. Wind fans the fire. Prana also fans the mind. If there is no
wind, fire or light gets steady. Hatha Yogins approach Brahman by controlling Prana. Raja Yogins
approach Brahman by controlling mind.

In this Pranayama you need not close the nostrils. Simply close the eyes if you practise it in a
sitting posture. Forget the body and concentrate. If you practise this during walking, just feel
minutely the movement of the air that is inhaled and exhaled.

Pranayama While Walking

Walk with head up, shoulders back and with chest expanded. Inhale slowly through both
nostrils counting OM mentally 3 times, one count for each step. Then retain the breath till you count
12 OMs. Then exhale slowly through both nostrils till you count 6 OMs. Take the respiratory pause
or rest after one Pranayama counting 12 OMs. If you find it difficult to count OM with each step,
count OM without having any concern with the steps.

Kapalabhati can also be done during walking. Those who are very busy can practise the
above Pranayama during their morning and evening walks. It is like killing two birds with one
stone. You will find it very pleasant to practise Pranayama while walking in an open place, when
delightful gentle breeze is blowing. You will be invigorated and innervated quickly to a
considerable degree. Practise, feel and realise the marked, beneficial influence of this kind of

37

Pranayama. Those who walk briskly, repeating OM mentally or verbally do practise natural
Pranayama without any effort.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Pranayama in Savasana

Lie down on the back, quiet at ease, over a blanket. Keep the hands on the ground by the side
and legs straight. The heels should be kept together, but the toes can remain a little apart. Relax all
the muscles and the nerves. Those who are very weak, can practise Pranayama in this pose while
lying on the ground or on a bedstead. Draw the breath slowly without making any noise, through
both nostrils. Retain the breath as long as you can do it with comfort. Then exhale slowly through
both nostrils. Repeat the process 12 times in the morning and 12 times in the evening. Chant OM
mentally during the practice. If you like you can practise the ‘easy comfortable posture’ also. This is
a combined exercise of Asana, Pranayama, meditation and rest. It gives rest not only to the body but
also for the mind. It gives relief, comfort and ease. This is very suitable for aged people.

Rhythmical Breathing

The breathing in men and women is very irregular. In exhalation the Prana goes out 16 digits
and in inhalation only 12 digits, thus losing 4 digits. But if you inhale for 16 digits as in exhalation
then you will have rhythmical breathing. Then the power Kundalini will be roused. By the practice
of rhythmical breathing you will enjoy real good rest. You can control the respiratory centre that is
situated in medulla oblongata and other nerves also, because the centre of respiration has a sort of
controlling effect on other nerves. He who has calm nerves, has a calm mind also.

If the units of exhalation and inhalation are the same, you will have rhythmical breathing. If
you inhale till you count 6 OMs, exhale also till you count 6 OMs. This is breathing in and out in a
measured manner. This will harmonise the whole system. This will harmonise the physical body,
mind, Indriyas and will soothe the tired nerves. You will experience full repose and calmness. All
the bubbling emotions will subside and the surging impulses will calm down.

There is another variety of modification of rhythmic breathing. Inhale slowly through both
nostrils for 4 OMs; retain the breath for 8 OMs (internal Kumbhaka); exhale slowly through both
nostrils for 4 OMs; and retain the breath outside (external Kumbhaka) for 8 OMs.

Repeat the above process a number of times according to your strength and capacity. You
can gradually increase the duration of inhalation and exhalation after some practice of 8 OMs and
the period between breaths to 16 OMs. But never try to increase the duration until you are sure that
you have power and strength to do so. You must experience joy and pleasure in doing the same. You
should not feel any undue strain. Pay considerable attention to keep up the rhythm. Remember that
the rhythm is more important than the length of breath. You must feel the rhythm throughout your
whole body. Practice will make you perfect. Patience and perseverance are needed.

Surya Bheda

Surya Bheda

Sit on Padmasana or Siddhasana. Close the eyes. Keep the left nostril closed with your right
ring and little fingers. Slowly inhale without making any sound as long as you can do it comfortably
through the right nostril. Then close the right nostril with your right thumb and retain the breath
firmly pressing the chin against the chest (Jalandhara Bandha). Hold on the breath till perspiration
oozes from the tips of the nails and roots of the hairs (hair follicles). This point cannot be reached at
the very outside. You will have to increase the period of Kumbhaka gradually. This is the limit of
the sphere of practice of Surya Bheda Kumbhaka. Then exhale very slowly without making any
sound through the left nostril by closing the right nostril with the thumb. Repeat OM mentally with
Bhava and meaning during inhalation, retention and exhalation. Exhale after purifying the skull by
forcing the breath up.

This Pranayama should again and again be performed, as it purifies the brain and destroys
the intestinal worms and diseases arising from excess of wind (Vayu). This removes the four kinds
of evils caused by Vayu and cures Vata or rheumatism. It cures rhinitis, cephalalgia and various
sorts of neuralgia. The worms that are found in the frontal sinuses are removed. It destroys decay
and death, awakens Kundalini Sakti and increases the bodily fire.

Sit in Padmasana or Siddhasana. Close the mouth. Inhale slowly through both the nostrils in

a smooth, uniform manner till the breath fills the space from the throat to the heart.

Retain the breath as long as you can do it comfortably and then exhale slowly through the
left nostril by closing the right nostril with your right thumb. Expand the chest when you inhale.
During inhalation a peculiar sound is produced owing to the partial closing of glottis. The sound
produced during inhalation should be of a mild and uniform pitch. It should be continuous also.
This Kumbhaka may be practised even when walking or standing. Instead of exhaling through the
left nostril, you can exhale slowly through both nostrils.

This removes the heat in the head. The practitioner becomes very beautiful. The gastric fire
is increased. It removes all the evils arising in the body and the Dhatus and cures Jalodara (dropsy of
the belly or ascites). It removes phlegm in the throat, Asthma, consumption and all sorts of
pulmonary diseases are cured. All diseases that arise from deficient inhalation of oxygen, and
diseases of the heart are cured. All works are accomplished by Ujjayi Pranayama. The practitioner
is never attacked by diseases of phlegm, nerves, dyspepsia, dysentery, enlarged spleen,
consumption, cough or fever. Perform Ujjayi to destroy decay and death.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Fold the tongue so that the tip of the tongue might touch the upper palate and draw the air
through the mouth with a hissing sound C C C C (or Si, Si, Si, Si). Then retain the breath as long as
you can without the feeling of suffocation and then exhale slowly through both nostrils. You can
keep the two rows of teeth in contact and then inhale the air through the mouth as before.

The practice enhances the beauty of the practitioner and vigour of his body. It removes
hunger, thirst, indolence and sleep. His strength will be just like that of Indra. He becomes the Lord
of Yogins. He is able to do and undo things. He becomes an independent monarch. He becomes
invincible. No injury will affect him. When you are thirsty, practise this. You will be relieved of
thirst immediately.

Protrude the tongue a little away from the lips. Fold the tongue like a tube. Draw in the air
through the mouth with the hissing sound Si. Retain the breath as long as you can hold on with
comfort. Then exhale slowly through both nostrils. Practise this daily again and again in the
morning from 15 to 30 times. You can do this either on Padmasana, Siddhasana, Vajrasana or even
when you stand or walk.

Sitkari

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

This Pranayama purifies the blood. It quenches thirst and appeases hunger. It cools the
system. It destroys Gulma (chronic dyspepsia), Pleeha, inflammation of various chronic diseases,
fever, consumption, indigestion, bilious disorders, phlegm, the bad effects of poison, snake-bite,
etc. When you are caught up in a jungle or any place where you cannot get water, if you feel thirsty,
practise this Pranayama. You will be at once relieved of thirst. He who practises this Pranayama
regularly, will not be affected by the bite of serpents and scorpions. Sitali Kumbhaka is an imitation
of the respiration of a serpent. The practitioner gets the power of casting his skin and enduring the
privation of air, water and food. He becomes a proof against all sorts of inflammations and fever.

Bhastrika

In Sanskrit Bhastrika means ‘bellows’. Rapid succession of forcible expulsion is a
characteristic feature of Bhastrika. Just as a blacksmith blows his bellows rapidly, so also you
should move your breath rapidly.

Sit on Padmasana. Keep the body, neck and head erect. Close the mouth. Next, inhale and
exhale quickly ten times like the bellows of the blacksmith. Constantly dilate and contract. When
you practise this Pranayama a hissing sound is produced. The practitioner should start with rapid
expulsions of breath following one another in rapid succession. When the required number of
expulsions, say ten for a round, is finished, the final expulsion is followed by a deepest possible
inhalation. The breath is suspended as long as it could be done with comfort. Then deepest possible
exhalation is done very slowly. The end of this deep exhalation completes one round of Bhastrika.
Rest a while after one round is over by taking a few normal breaths. This will give you relief and
make you fit for starting the second round. Do three rounds daily in the morning. You can do
another three rounds in the evening also. Busy people who find it difficult to do three rounds of
Bhastrika can do one round at least. This also will keep them quite fit.

Bhastrika is a powerful exercise. A combination of Kapalabhati and Ujjayi makes up
Bhastrika. Practise Kapalabhati and Ujjayi to start with. Then you will find it very easy to do
Bhastrika.

Some prolong the practice till they get tired. You will get perspiration profusely. If you
experience any giddiness stop the practice and take a few normal breaths. Continue the practice
after the giddiness has vanished. Bhastrika can be done both in the morning and evening in winter.
In summer do it in the morning only during cool hours.

Bhastrika relieves inflammation of the throat, increases gastric fire, destroys phlegm,
removes diseases of the nose and chest and eradicates asthma, consumption, etc. It gives good
appetite. It breaks the three Granthis or knots viz., Brahma Granthi, Vishnu Granthi and Rudra
Granthi. It destroys phlegm which is the bolt or obstacle to the door at the mouth of Brahma Nadi
(Sushumna). It enables one to know the Kundalini. It removes all diseases which arise from excess
of wind, bile and phlegm. It gives warmth to the body. When you have no sufficient warm clothing
in a cool region to protect yourself from cold, practise this Pranayama and you will get sufficient
warmth in the body quickly. It purifies the Nadis considerably. It is the most beneficial of all
Kumbhakas. Bhastrika Kumbhaka should be specially practised as it enables the Prana to break

42

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

through the three Granthis or knots that are firmly located in the Sushumna. It awakens the
Kundalini quickly. The practitioner will never suffer from any disease. He will always be healthy.

The number of exhalations or rounds is determined by the strength and capacity of the

practitioner. You must not go to extremes. Some students do six rounds. Some do twelve also.

You can practise Bhastrika in the following manner. There is some slight change in the end.
Having inhaled and exhaled quickly twenty times, inhale through the right nostril, retain the breath
as long as you can do it comfortably and then exhale through the left nostril. Then inhale through
the left nostril, retain the breath as before and then exhale through the right nostril.

Repeat OM mentally with Bhava and meaning throughout the practice.

There are some varieties of Bhastrika wherein one nostril only is used for breathing

purposes and in another variety the alternate nostrils are used for inhalation and exhalation.

Those who wish to do Bhastrika for a long time in an intense manner should live on

Khichdi, and take an enema or do Bhasti in the morning before starting the practice.

Sit on Padmasana or Siddhasana. Inhale rapidly through both nostrils making sound of

Bhramara, the bee, and exhale rapidly through both nostrils, making the humming sound.

You can carry the process till the body is bathed in perspiration. In the end inhale through
both nostrils, retain the breath as long as you can do it comfortably and then exhale slowly through
both nostrils. The joy which the practitioner gets in making the Kumbhaka is unlimited and
indescribable. In the beginning, heat of the body is increased as the circulation of blood is
quickened. In the end the body-heat is decreased by perspiration. By success in this Bhramari
Kumbhaka the Yogic student gets success in Samadhi.

Sit in your Asana and inhale. Retain the breath. Do Jalandhara Bandha by pressing the chin
against the chest. Retain the breath till you expect fainting and then exhale slowly. This is Murchha
Kumbhaka as it makes the mind senseless and gives happiness. But this is not suitable for many.

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Murcha Pranayama

Plavini

Practice of this Pranayama demands skill on the part of the student. He who practises this
Plavini can do Jalastambha (solidification of water) and float on water for any length of time. Mr.
‘S’ a Yogic student can float on water for twelve hours at a stretch. He who practises this Plavini
Kumbhaka can live on air and dispense with food for some days. The student actually drinks air like
water slowly and sends it to the stomach. The stomach gets bloated a bit. If you tap the stomach
when it is filled with air, you will get a peculiar tympanic (air) sound. Gradual practice is necessary.
The help of one who is well versed in this Pranayama is also necessary. The student can expel all the
air from the stomach by gradual belching.

Kevala Kumbhaka

Kumbhaka is of two kinds, viz., Sahita and Kevala. That which is coupled with inhalation
and exhalation is termed Sahita. That which is devoid of these, is called Kevala (alone). When you
get mastery in Sahita, then you can attempt this Kevala. When in due course of practice, the
Kumbhaka subsists in many places without exhalation and inhalation and unconditioned by place,
time and number—then that Kumbhaka is called absolute and pure (Kevala Kumbhaka), the fourth
form of ‘Regulation of breath’. Such powers as that of roaming about in space unseen, follow this
last form of Pranayama. In Vasishtha Samhita it is said: “When after giving up inhalation and
exhalation, one holds his breath with ease, it is absolute Kumbhaka (Kevala).” In this Pranayama
the breath is suddenly stopped without Puraka and Rechaka. The student can retain his breath as

44

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

long as he likes through this Kumbhaka. He attains the state of Raja Yoga. Through Kevala
Kumbhaka, the knowledge of Kundalini arises. Kundalini is aroused and the Sushumna is free from
all sorts of obstacles. He attains perfection in Hatha Yoga. You can practise this Kumbhaka three
times a day. He who knows Pranayama and Kevala is the real Yogi. What can he not accomplish in
the three worlds, who has acquired success in this Kevala Kumbhaka? Glory, glory to such exalted
souls. This Kumbhaka cures all diseases and promotes longevity.

Pranic Healing

Those who practise Pranayama, can impart their Prana in healing morbid diseases. They can
also recharge themselves with Prana in no time by practising Kumbhaka. Never think that you will
be depleted of your Prana by distributing it to others. The more you give, the more it will flow to you
from the cosmic source (Hiranyagarbha). That is the law of nature. Do not become a niggard. If
there is a rheumatic patient, gently shampoo his legs with your hands. When you do shampooing
(massage), do Kumbhaka and imagine that the Prana is flowing from your hands towards the leg of
your patient. Connect yourself with Hiranyagarbha or the Cosmic Prana and imagine that the
cosmic energy is flowing through your hands towards the legs of the patient. The patient will at
once feel warmth, relief and strength. You can cure headache, intestinal colic or any other disease
by massage and by your magnetic touch. When you massage the liver, spleen, stomach or any other
portion or organ of the body, you can speak to the cells and give them orders: “O cells! discharge
your functions properly. I command you to do so.” They will obey your orders. They too have got
subconscious intelligence. Repeat OM when you pass your Prana to others. Try a few cases. You
will gain competence. You can cure scorpion-sting also. Gently shampoo the leg and bring the
poison down.

You can have extraordinary power of concentration, strong will and a perfectly healthy and
strong body by practising Pranayama regularly. You will have to direct the power of Prana
consciously to unhealthy parts of the body. Suppose you have a sluggish liver. Sit on Padmasana.
Close your eyes. Inhale gently till you count OM 3 times. Then retain breath till you count OM 6
times. Direct the Prana to the region of the liver. Concentrate your mind there. Fix your attention to
that area. Imagine that Prana is interpenetrating all the tissues and the cells of the lobes of the liver
and doing its curative, regenerating and constructive work there. Faith, imagination, attention and
interest play a very important part in curing disease by taking Prana to the diseased areas. Then
slowly exhale. During exhalation imagine that the morbid impurities of the liver are thrown out.
Repeat this process 12 times in the morning and 12 times in the evening. Sluggishness of liver will
vanish in a few days. This is a drugless treatment. This is nature-cure. You can take the Prana to any
part of the body during Pranayama and cure any kind of disease, be it acute or chronic. Try once or
twice in healing yourself. Your convictions will grow stronger. Why do you cry like the lady who is
crying for ghee when she has butter in her hand, when you have a cheap, potent, easily available
remedy or agent Prana at your command at all times! Use it judiciously. When you advance in your
concentration and practice, you can cure many diseases by mere touch. In the advanced stages,
many diseases are cured by mere will.

45

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

Distant Healing

This is known as ‘absent treatment’ also. You can transmit your Prana through space, to
your friend, who is living at a distance. He should have a receptive mental attitude. You must feel
yourself en rapport (in direct relation and in sympathy) with the man, whom you heal with this
Distant Healing method.

You can fix hours of appointment with them through correspondence. You can write to
them: “Get ready at 4 a.m. Have a receptive mental attitude. Lie down in an easy chair. Close your
eyes. I shall transmit my Prana.” Say mentally to the patient: “I am transmitting a supply of Prana
(vital force).” Do Kumbhaka when you send the Prana. Practise rhythmical breathing also. Have a
mental image that the Prana is leaving your mind when you exhale; it is passing through space and
is entering the system of the patient. The Prana travels unseen like the wireless (radio) waves and
flashes like lightning across space. The Prana that is coloured by the thoughts of the healer is
projected outside. You can recharge yourself with Prana by practising Kumbhaka. This requires
long, steady and regular practice.

Relaxation

The practice of relaxing the muscles of the body will bring rest to the body and to the mind
also. The tension of the muscles will be relieved. People who know the science of relaxation do not
waste any energy. They can meditate well. Take a few deep breaths and then lie down flat on your
back as in Savasana. Relax all the muscles of the body from head to feet. Roll on to one side and
then relax as thoroughly as you can do. Do not strain the muscles. Roll on the other side and relax.
This is naturally done by all during sleep. There are various exercises in relaxation, for the
particular muscles of a particular part of the body. You can relax the head, the shoulders, the arms,
forearms, wrist, etc. Yogins know the science of relaxation thoroughly. When you practise these
various relaxation exercises, you must have the mental picture of calmness and strength.

Relaxation of Mind

Mental poise and calmness may be brought about by the eradication of worry and anger.
Fear really underlies both worry and anger. Nothing is gained by worry and anger, but on the
contrary much energy is wasted by these two kinds of lower emotions. If a man worries much and if
he is irritable, he is indeed a very weak man. Be careful and thoughtful. All unnecessary worries can
be avoided. Relaxation of the muscles reacts on the mind and brings repose to the mind. Relaxation
of the mind brings rest to the body also. Body and mind are intimately connected. Body is a mould
prepared by the mind for its enjoyment.

Sit for 15 minutes in a relaxed and easy comfortable position. Close your eyes. Withdraw
the mind from outside objects. Still the mind. Silence the bubbling thoughts. Think that the body is
like a coconut shell and you are entirely different from the body. Think that the body is an
instrument in your hands. Identify yourself with the all-pervading Spirit or Atman. Imagine that the
whole world and your body are floating like a piece of straw in this vast ocean of Spirit. Feel that
you are in touch with the Supreme Being. Feel that the life of the whole world is pulsating, vibrating
and throbbing through you. Feel that the ocean of life is gently rocking you on its vast bosom. Then

46

open your eyes. You will experience immense mental peace, mental vigour and mental strength.
Practise and feel this.

Importance and Benefits of Pranayama

“The illusory Samsaric Vasana that has arisen through the practice of many lives, never
perishes except through the practice of Yoga for a long time. It is not possible on the part of one to
control
through the approved means”
(Muktikopanishad).

the mind by sitting up again and again except

“How could Jnana, capable of giving Moksha, arise certainly without Yoga? And even
Yoga becomes powerless in securing Moksha when it is devoid of Jnana. So the aspirant after
emancipation should practise (firmly) both Yoga and Jnana” (Yogatattva Upanishad).

“Tatah kshiyate prakasavaranam—Thence the covering of the light is destroyed” (Yoga
Sutras—II-52). Tamas and Rajas constitute the covering or veil. This veil is removed by the
practice of Pranayama. After the veil is removed, the real nature of the soul is realised. The Chitta is
by itself made up of the Sattvic particles, but it is enveloped by Rajas and Tamas, just as the fire is
enveloped by smoke. There is no purificatory action greater than Pranayama. Pranayama gives
purity and the light of knowledge shines. The Karma of the Yogi, which covers up the
discriminative knowledge is destroyed as he practises Pranayama. By the magic panorama of
desire, the essence, which is luminous by nature is covered up and the Jiva or individual soul is
directed towards vice. This Karma of the Yogi which covers up the Light and binds him to repeated
births, becomes attenuated by the practice of Pranayama every moment and is destroyed eventually.
The afflictions and sins constitute the cover according to Vachaspati.

Manu says: “Let the defects be burnt up by Pranayama.” Vishnu Purana speaks of
Pranayama as an accessory to Yoga: “He who wants the air known as Prana by practice is said to
have secured Pranayama.”

“Dharanasu cha yogyata manasah—The mind becomes fit for concentration” (Yoga
Sutras, II-53). You will be able to concentrate the mind, nicely after this veil of the light has been
removed. The mind will be quite steady like the flame in a windless place as the disturbing energy
has been removed. The word Pranayama is sometimes used collectively for inhalation, retention
and exhalation of breath and sometimes for each of these severally. When the Prana Vayu moves in
the Akasa-Tattva, the breathing will be lessened. At this time it will be easy to stop the breath. The
velocity of the mind will be slowly lessened by Pranayama. It will induce Vairagya.

If you can suspend one inch or digit of breath inside, you will obtain the powers of
foretelling; if you can suspend two inches within, you will get the power of thought-reading, for
suspending the breath for three inches, levitation; for four inches, psychometry, clairaudience, etc;
for five inches, moving about unseen by anybody in the world; for six inches, the power of ‘Kaya
Siddhi’; for seven inches, entering the body of another man (Parakaya Pravesa); for eight inches,
the power to remain always young; for nine inches, the power to make Devas to work as your
servants; for ten inches Anima, Mahima and other Siddhis; and for eleven inches, you will attain
oneness with Paramatman. When through great practice the Yogi can perform Kumbhaka for full

47

three hours, then he can balance himself on his thumb. He undoubtedly attains all kinds of Siddhis.
Just as fire destroys the fuel, so also Pranayama destroys the bundles of sins. Pratyahara makes the
mind calm. Dharana steadies the mind. Dhyana makes one forget the body and the world. Samadhi
brings infinite Bliss, Knowledge, Peace and Liberation.

During Yogic Samadhi, the flame of the Yogagni (fire of Yoga) extending from navel to the
head melts the Amrita in the Brahmarandhra. The Yogi drinks this with joy and ecstasy. He can
remain without food and drink for months by drinking this Yogic nectar alone.

The body becomes lean, strong and healthy. Too much fat is reduced. There is lustre in the
face. Eyes sparkle like a diamond. The practitioner becomes very handsome. Voice becomes sweet
and melodious. The inner Anahata sounds are distinctly heard. The student is free from all sorts of
diseases. He gets established in Brahmacharya. Semen gets firm and steady. The Jatharagni (gastric
fire) is augmented. The student becomes so perfect in Brahmacharya that his mind will not be
shaken even if a fairy tries to embrace him. Appetite becomes keen. Nadis are purified. The
Vikshepa is removed and the mind becomes one-pointed. Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. The mind
is prepared for Dharana and Dhyana. The excretions become scanty. Steady practice arouses inner
spiritual light, happiness and peace of mind. It makes him an Urdhvareto-Yogi. Advanced students
only will get all the other Siddhis mentioned above.

The mind of a man can be made to transcend ordinary experience and exist on a plane higher
than that of reason known as superconscious state of concentration and get beyond the limit of
concentration. He comes face to face with facts which ordinary consciousness cannot comprehend.
This ought to be achieved by proper training and manipulation of the subtle forces of the body so as
to cause them to give, as it were, an upward push to the mind into the higher regions. When the mind
is so raised into the superconscious state of perception, it begins to act from there and experiences
higher facts and higher knowledge. Such is the ultimate object of Yoga, which can be achieved by
the practice of Pranayama. The control of the vibratory Prana means to a Yogi, the kindling of the
fire of supreme knowledge, the realisation of the Self.

Special Instructions

1. In the early morning, answer the calls of nature and sit for the practice. Practise
Pranayama, in a dry well-ventilated room. Pranayama requires deep concentration and attention. It
is always better to have the practice in a steady sitting posture. Do not keep anyone by your side to
avoid distraction of your mind.

2. Before you sit for Pranayama practice, thoroughly clean the nostrils well. You can take a
small quantity of fruit-juice or a small cup of milk or coffee even before the practice. When you
finish the practice take a cup of milk or light tiffin after 10 minutes.

3. Have one sitting only in the morning during summer. If there is heat in the brain or head,
apply Amla oil or butter on the head before you take your bath. Take Misri Sherbat by dissolving
sugar candy in water. This will cool your whole system. Do Sitali Pranayama also. You will not be
affected by the heat.

48

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

4. Strictly avoid too much talking, eating, sleeping, mixing with friends and exertion.
“Verily Yoga is not for him who eateth too much, nor who abstaineth to excess, is addicted to too
much sleep nor even to wakefulness” (Gita VI-16). Take a little ghee with rice when you take your
meals. This will lubricate the bowels and allow Vayu to move downwards freely.

5. “Mitaharam vina yastu yogarambham tu karayet, Nanaroga bhavettasya kinchid yogo
na sidhyati—Without observing moderation of diet, if one takes to the Yoga practices, he cannot
obtain any benefit but gets various diseases” (Ghe.S. Chap. V-16).

6. Perfect celibacy for six months or one year will doubtless enable you to acquire rapid
progress in the practice and in spiritual advancement. Do not talk with ladies. Do not laugh and joke
with them. Shun their company entirely. Without Brahmacharya and dietetic regulations if you
practise Yogic exercises, you will not get maximum benefit in the spiritual practices. But, for
ordinary health you can practise mild exercises.

7. Be regular and systematic in your practice. Never miss a day. Stop the practice when you
are ailing seriously. Some people twist the muscles of the face when they do Kumbhaka. It should
be avoided. It is a symptom to indicate that they are going beyond their capacity. This must be
strictly avoided. Such people cannot have a regulated Rechaka and Puraka.

8. Obstacles in Yoga: “Sleeping in day time, late vigil over night, excess of urine and faeces,
evil of unwholesome food and laborious mental operation with Prana.” When one is attacked by
any disease, he says that the disease is due to the practice of Yoga. This is a serious mistake.

9. Get up at 4 a.m. Meditate or do Japa for half an hour. Then do Asanas and Mudras. Take
rest for 15 minutes. Then do Pranayama. Physical exercises can be conveniently combined with
Asanas. If you have sufficient time at your disposal, you can have it after finishing all the Yogic
exercises and meditation. Pranayama can also be performed as soon as you get up from bed just
before Japa and meditation. It will make your body light and you will enjoy the meditation. You
must have a routine according to your convenience and time.

10. Maximum benefit can be derived if Japa also is done during the practice of Asanas and

Pranayama.

11. It is always better to start Japa and meditation in the early morning at 4 a.m., as soon as
you get up from bed. At this time the mind is quite calm and refreshed. You can have good
concentration.

12. Vast majority of persons waste their precious time in the early morning in answering the
calls of nature for half an hour and washing their teeth for another half an hour. This is bad.
Aspirants should try to defecate within 5 minutes and cleanse their teeth within 5 minutes. If the
bowels are constipated, have vigorous practice of Salabha, Bhujanga and Dhanur Asanas for 5
minutes as soon as you get up from bed. If you are habituated to answer the call of nature, late, you
can do so after finishing the Yogic exercises.

49

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

13. First do Japa and meditation. Then you can take to Asana and Pranayama exercises.

Then finish the course of practice by another short sitting in meditation.

14. AS there is always some drowsiness when you get up from bed, it is desirable to do some
Asanas and a little Pranayama for five minutes just to drive off this drowsiness and to make you fit
for meditation. The mind gets one-pointed after the practice of Pranayama. Pranayama, though it
concerns with the breath, gives good exercise for various internal organs and the whole body.

15. The general order of doing Kriyas is: First do all Asanas, then Mudras, then Pranayama
and then Dhyana. Since the early morning time is suitable for meditation, you can follow this order:
Japa, Meditation, Asanas, Mudras and Pranayama. This is a better way. You can follow the order
which is suitable to you. After doing Asanas, take rest for five minutes and then begin Pranayama.

16. Some Hatha Yogic books interdict cold bath in the early morning. Probably the reason
may be that one may catch cold or develop any complaint of the lungs, if he takes cold bath at 4 a.m.
particularly in cold places like Kashmir, Mussoorie, Darjeeling, etc. There is no restriction in hot
places. I am always in favour of cold baths before one starts the Yogic practices as it is refreshing
and stimulating. It drives off drowsiness. It brings in equilibrium of circulation of blood. There is a
healthy flow of blood towards the brain.

17. Asanas and Pranayama remove all sorts of diseases, improve health, energise digestion,
invigorate the nerves, straighten the Sushumna Nadi, remove Rajas and awaken Kundalini. Practice
of Asanas and Pranayama bestows good health and steady mind. As no Sadhana is possible without
good health and as no meditation is possible without a steady mind, Hatha Yoga is of immense use
for Dhyana Yogins, Karma Yogins, Bhaktas and Vedantins as well.

18. The maintenance of the body is impossible without Asanas or any kind of physical
exercises or activities. Even an orthodox Vedantin is an unconscious Hatha Yogi. He practises
some kind of Asana daily. He practises Pranayama also unconsciously because during meditation,
Pranayama comes by itself.

19. Whenever you feel uneasy, depressed or dejected, practise Pranayama. You will be at
once filled with new vigour, energy and strength. You will be elevated, renovated and filled with
joy. Do this and try. Before you begin to write something, an essay, an article or a thesis, do
Pranayama first. You will bring out beautiful ideas and it will be an inspiring, powerful and original
production.

20. Be regular in the practice. Regularity in the practice is very necessary if one wants to
realise the maximum benefits of Asanas and Pranayama. Those who practise by fits and starts will
not derive much benefit. Generally people practise for two months in the beginning with great
enthusiasm and leave off the practice. This is a sad mistake. They always want a Yogic teacher by
their side. They have got the effeminate leaning mentality. They are lazy, torpid and slothful.

21. People do not want to remove Mala (impurity) by selfless service and Vikshepa by
Yogic practices. They at once jump to awaken the Kundalini and raise Brahmakara Vritti. They will
only break their legs. Those who attempt to awaken the Kundalini by Asanas and Pranayama,

50

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

should have purity in thought, word and deed. They should have mental and physical
Brahmacharya. Then only they can enjoy the benefits of awakening the Kundalini.

22. Sow the seed of spirituality in your young age. Do not waste Virya. Discipline the
Indriyas and mind. Do Sadhana. When you become old, it will be difficult for you to do any rigid
Sadhana. Therefore be on the alert during your teens; you will see for yourself in a short time the
particular benefits you derive from particular kinds of Sadhana.

23. When you advance in spiritual practices, you must observe strict Mouna (vow of
silence) for 24 hours continuously. This must be continued for some months also. Everyone should
select a course of few exercises in Asana, Pranayama and meditation according to one’s
temperament, capacity, convenience and requirement.

24. It is quite possible for a man to practise celibacy, albeit there are various sorts of
temptations and distractions. A well-disciplined life, study of scriptures, Satsanga, Japa, Dhyana,
Pranayama, Sattvic and moderate diet, daily introspection, and enquiry, self-analysis and
self-correction, Sadachara, practice of Yama, Niyama, physical and verbal Tapas, all will pave a
long way in the attainment of this end. People have irregular, unrighteous, immoderate, irreligious,
undisciplined life. Hence they suffer and fail in the attainment of the goal of life. Just as the elephant
throws sand on its own head, so also they themselves bring difficulties and troubles on their own
heads on account of their foolishness.

25. Do not shake the body unnecessarily. By shaking the body often the mind also is
disturbed. Do not stretch the body every now and then. The Asana should be steady and firm as a
rock when you do Pranayama, Japa and meditation.

26. You must find out for yourself according to your health and constitution what sort of
dietetic regulation will suit and what particular Pranayama will exactly help you. Then only you can
safely proceed with your Sadhana. First read all the instructions of the various exercises given in
this book from the beginning to the end. Clearly understand the technique. If you have any doubts,
just ask any Yogic student to demonstrate and then practise it. This is the safest method. You should
not select any one of the exercise at random and begin to practise it in a wrong way.

27. In all the exercises I have suggested Mantra ‘OM’ as the time-unit. You can have your
Guru Mantra, Rama, Siva, Gayatri or mere number as the time-unit according to your inclination.
Gayatri or OM is the best for Pranayama. In the beginning you must observe some time-unit for
Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka. The time-unit and the proper ratio comes by itself when you do
the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka as long as you can do it comfortably. When you have advanced
in the practice, you need not count or keep any unit. You will be naturally established in the normal
ratio through force of habit.

28. For some days in the beginning you must count the number and see how you progress. In
the advanced stages, you need not distract the mind in counting. The lungs will tell you when the
required number is finished.

51

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

29. Do not continue the Pranayama when you are fatigued. There must be always joy and
exhilaration of spirit during and after the practice. You should come out of the practice fully
invigorated and refreshed. Do not bind yourself by too many rules (Niyamas).

30. Do not take bath immediately after Pranayama is over. Take rest for half an hour. If you
get perspiration during the practice, do not wipe it with a towel. Rub it with your hands. Do not
expose the body to the chill draughts of air when you perspire.

31. Always inhale and exhale very slowly. Do not make any sound. In Pranayamas like
Bhastrika, Kapalabhati, Sitali and Sitkari, you can produce a little mild or the lowest possible
sound.

32. You should not expect the benefits after doing it for 2 or 3 minutes only for a day or two.
At least you must have 15 minutes daily practice in the beginning regularly for days together. There
will be no use if you jump from one exercise to another everyday. You must have a particular
exercise for your daily Abhyasa, which you should improve to a high degree. Other exercises of
course, you can have for occasional practice along with the daily exercise. You must have
Bhastrika, Kapalabhati and ‘Easy Comfortable Pranayama’ for your daily practice; and Sitali,
Sitkari, etc., can be practised occasionally.

33. The Puraka is otherwise known as ‘Nissvasa’ and Rechaka is known as ‘Uchhvasa’. The
mental process in Kevala Kumbhaka is called ‘Sunyaka’ form of breath regulation. Steady,
systematic practice and gradual increase of Kumbhaka is known as ‘Abhyasa Yoga’, swallowing of
air and living on this air alone is known as ‘Vayubhakshana’.

34. The author of Sivayoga Dipika describes three kinds of Pranayama: Prakrita, Vaikrita
and Kevala Kumbhaka. “If the Prana is in the form of breath inhaled and exhaled, on account of its
natural quality of going out and coming in, the Pranayama is known as Prakrita. If the Prana is
restrained by the threefold means of throwing out, taking in and stopping the breath in accordance
with the rules prescribed in the Sastras, it is called Vaikrita or artificial. But with great men who
have risen above these two kinds of restraining breath, the sudden restraining of the vital currents
directly (without inspiration and expiration), is Kevala Kumbhaka. Prakrita Pranayama belongs to
Mantra Yoga. Vaikrita belongs to Laya Yoga.”

35. “That is called Kumbhaka (cessation of breath) when there is neither expiration nor
inspiration and the body is motionless, remaining still in one state. Then he sees forms like the
blind, hears sounds like the deaf and sees the body like wood. This is the characteristic of one who
has attained quiescence.”

36. Patanjali does not lay much stress on practice of different kinds of Pranayama. He
mentions: “Exhale slowly, then inhale and retain the breath. You will get a steady and calm mind.”
It is only the Hatha Yogins who developed Pranayama as a science and have mentioned various
exercises to suit different persons.

37. “Spread a tiger-skin or a deer-skin or a fourfold blanket. Over this spread a piece of

white cloth. Then sit for the Pranayama practice facing the North.”

52

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

38. Some would take the order as exhaling, inhaling and retaining; others as inhaling,
retaining and exhaling. The latter is more common. In Yajnavalkya, we find the different kinds of
breath regulation mentioned in the order of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka; whereas, in Naradiya
text we have them in the order of Rechaka, Puraka and Kumbhaka. The two are to be regulated as
optional alternatives.

39. A Yogi should always avoid fear, anger, laziness, too much sleep or waking and too
much food or fasting. If the above rule be well strictly practised, each day, spiritual wisdom will
arise of itself in three months without doubt; in four months, he sees the Devas; in five months he
knows or becomes a Brahmanishtha; and truly in six months he attains Kaivalya at will. There is no
doubt.

40. A neophyte should do Puraka and Rechaka only without any Kumbhaka for some days.

Take a long time to do Rechaka. The proportion for Puraka and Rechaka is 1:2.

41. Pranayama in its popular and preparatory form may be practised by every one in any
posture whatsoever, sitting or walking; and yet is sure to show its benefits. But to those who practise
it in accordance with the specific methods prescribed, fructification will be rapid.

42. Gradually increase the period of Kumbhaka. Retain for 4 seconds in the first week, for 8
seconds in the second week, for 12 seconds in the third week and so on, till you are able to retain the
breath to your full capacity.

43. Common-sense or Yukti should be used throughout your practice. If one kind of
exercise is not agreeable to your system, change it after due consideration or consultation with your
Guru. This is Yukti. Where there is Yukti, there is Siddhi, Bhukti and Mukti (perfection, enjoyment
and salvation).

44. You must so nicely adjust the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka that you should not
experience the feeling of suffocation or discomfort at any stage of Pranayama. You should never
feel the necessity of catching hold of a few normal breaths between any two successive rounds. The
duration of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka must be properly adjusted. Exercise due care and
attention. Matters will turn to be successful and easy.

45. You must not unnecessarily prolong the period of exhalation. If you prolong the time of
Rechaka, the following inhalation will be done in a hurried manner and the rhythm will be
disturbed. You must so carefully regulate the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka that must be
absolutely comfortable and perform not only one Pranayama but also the full course or required
rounds of Pranayama. Experience and practice will make you alright. Practice makes one perfect.
Be steady. Another important factor is that you must have efficient control over the lungs at the end
of Kumbhaka to enable you to do the Rechaka smoothly and in proportion with the Puraka.

46. Suryabheda and Ujjayi produce heat. Sitkari and Sitali are cooling. Bhastrika preserves
normal temperature. Suryabheda destroys excess of wind; Ujjayi phlegm; Sitkari and Sitali bile;
and Bhastrika all the three.

53

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

47. Suryabheda and Ujjayi must be practised during winter. Sitkari and Sitali must be
practised in summer. Bhastrika can be practised in all seasons. Those persons whose bodies are hot
even in winter can practise Sitali and Sitkari during winter season.

48. Goal of life is self-realisation. “This is brought about by means of the subjugation of the
body and the senses, the service to a good Guru, the hearing of Vedantic doctrine and constant
meditation thereon” (Niralamba Upanishad). “If you are really sincere and if you wish to have a
quick, sure success, you must have a systematic routine for Asana, Pranayama, Japa, Meditation,
Svadhyaya, etc. You must be very careful in keeping up Brahmacharya. Effective means to control
the mind are the attainment of spiritual knowledge, association with the wise, the entire abdication
of all Vasanas and control of Prana” (Muktikopanishad).

49. Once again I will tell you that Asana, Pranayama, Japa, Dhyana, Brahmacharya,
Satsanga, solitude, Mouna, Nishkama Karma are all absolutely necessary for spiritual attainments.
One can hardly obtain perfection in Raja Yoga without Hatha Yoga. At the end of Kumbhaka you
should withdraw the mind from all the objects. By gradual practice you will be established in Raja
Yoga.

50. Some students who are studying Vedantic books think that they are Jnanis and they
ignore Asanas, Pranayama, etc. They also should practise these, till they are perfect in Shat-Sampat
of the Sadhana-Chatushtaya—Sama, Dama, etc.,—the preliminary qualifications of Jnana Yoga.

51. Do not hesitate. Do not be waiting to get a Guru who will sit by your side and watch you
daily for a long time. If you are sincere, regular and systematic and if you follow rules and
instructions of this book very carefully, there will be no trouble at all. You will undoubtedly get
success. Slight errors may crop up in the beginning, it does not matter. Do not unnecessarily be
alarmed. Do not give up the practice. You will yourself learn how to adjust. Common-sense,
instinct, the shrill inner voice of the soul will help you in the path. Everything will come out
smoothly in the end. Start the practice this very second in right earnest and become a real Yogi.

OM Santih, Santih, Santih!

Concentration on Solar Plexus

Solar plexus is often called the abdominal brain. It is an important centre of the nerves,
connected with the sympathetic nervous system. It is located in the Epigastric region, behind the pit
of the stomach on either side of the spinal column. It has control on the main internal organs of man.
It plays a much more important part than is generally recognised. It takes an important part in the
control of emotions and of various bodily functions. It is composed of white and grey brain matter.
It is one of the most vital parts of the body. A blow over the solar plexus is well-known to boxing
men as a ready means of rendering an opponent unconscious or at any rate helpless. It is the
store-house of Prana. It is the power-house. It is the most important of all the Adharas (supports) of
the body that are sixteen in number. It is a known fact that men have been instantly killed by a

54

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

severe blow over the solar plexus. The solar plexus is literally the sun of the nervous system. When
the sun is shining harmoniously, the whole of the physical system is harmonious. It radiates
strength and energy to all parts of the body. Thoughts and Prana, when directed towards this centre
through Pranayama, will stimulate and awaken the sunshine latent therein.

Sit erect in Padmasana or Siddhasana. Close your eyes. Draw the air slowly through the left
nostril as long as you can do with comfort. Keep the right one closed with your right thumb. Repeat
OM mentally. Then retain the breath. Have the attention well directed towards the solar plexus.
Concentrate your mind there. Have the thought centred upon it. Do not make any undue strain of the
mind or undue effort of any kind. Direct consciously the Prana to the region of solar plexus through
the retained breath. Imagine: “I am breathing in Prana, happiness, joy, strength, vigour, love.” Then
slowly exhale through the right nostril. Then inhale through the right nostril, retain it as before and
exhale through the left. Repeat the process 12 times in the morning. Fear, depression, weakness and
other undesirable emotions, which stand in the way of spiritual advancement, will vanish. You will
become more and more confident of success in Self-realisation.

There are five elements, viz., Prithvi, Apas, Agni, Vayu and Akasa. To the body of the five
elements, there is the five fold Dharana. From the feet to the knees is said to be the region of the
Prithvi. It is four-sided in shape, yellow in colour and has its Varna the Sanskrit letter ‘L’ along the
region of the earth, i.e., from the feet to the knees. Contemplating upon this, one should perform
Dharana there for a period of two hours daily. He then attains mastery over the earth. Death does not
trouble him since he has obtained mastery over the ‘earth’ element.

The region of Apas is said to extend from the knees to the anus. Apas is semi-lunar in shape
and white in colour. It has the letter ‘Va’ for its Bijakshara—seed-letter. Carrying Up the breath
with the letter ‘Va’ along the region of Apas, one should contemplate on God Narayana, having
four arms, a crowned head, dressed in orange-colour clothes and as decayless. Practising Dharana
there daily for a period of two hours, he is freed from all sins. Then there is no fear for him from
water.

From the anus to the heart is said to be the region of Agni. Agni is triangular in shape, red in
colour and has the letter ‘R’ for its Bija. Raising the breath with the letter ‘Ra’ along the region of
fire, one should contemplate on Rudra, who has three eyes, who grants all wishes and who is of the
colour of mid-day sun. Practising Dharana there daily for a period of two hours, he is not burnt by
fire, even though his body enters into the fire-pit.

Vayavya Dharana

Akasa Dharana

From the heart to the middle of the eyebrows is said to be the region of Vayu. It is black in
colour and shines with the letter ‘Ya’. Carrying the breath along the region of Vayu, one should
contemplate on Isvara, the omniscient. The Yogi does not meet his death through Vayu.

From the centre of the eyebrow to the top of the head is said to be the region of Akasa. It is
circular in shape, smoky in colour and shines with the letter ‘Ha’. Raising the breath along the
region of Akasa, one should contemplate on Sadasiva. By practising this Dharana one obtains the
power of levitation. The Yogi gets all the Siddhis.

Story of Yogi Bhusunda

Bhusunda is one of the ‘Chiranjivis’ amongst the Yogins. He was the master of the science
of Pranayama. It said that a big nest, like that of mountain, was built by him on the southern branch
of the Kalpa Vriksha, situated at the northern summit of the ‘Mahameru’. In this nest, there lived the
crow, Bhusunda, by name. This crow is said to be the longest lived Yogi. He was a ‘Trikala Jnani’.
He could cognise all the three periods of time. He could sit in Yoga (Samadhi) for any length of
time. He was desireless. He had obtained supreme Santi and Jnana. He was there, enjoying the bliss
of his own Self and he is there still, being a Chiranjivi. He was for a long time engaged in the
worship of Brahmasakti ‘Alambusa’. At this spot of the Kalpa Vriksha, Bhusunda lived for many
Yugas, nay for many Kalpas. He would quit his nest at the time of Pralaya. He had the full
knowledge of the five Dharanas. He had rendered proof of himself against the five elements, by
practising the five methods of concentration. It is said that when all the twelve Adityas scorch the
world with their burning rays, he would through his Apas Dharana reach up the Akasa. When the
fierce gales arise splintering up the rocks to pieces, he would be in the Akasa, through Agni
Dharana. When the world together with its Mahameru would be under water, he would float on
them without any fluctuation through Vayu Dharana and when the time of universal destruction
arrived, he would be, as in Sushupti, in the Brahmic seat till the beginning of another creation of
Brahma. After this creation, he would again resort to the said nest for his abode. The Kalpa Vriksha,
at the summit of the mountain, through his Sankalpa (will-power) would arise and grow up in the
similar way, at the beginning of the next Kalpa, every time.

The Inner Factory

The food that you take consists of nitrogenous elements and proteins, fats or hydrocarbons
such as ghee and carbohydrates such as rice and sugar. Proteins build up the tissues and the muscles.
Carbohydrates produce energy. Besides these, there are various kinds of salts also. The various
digestive juices, saliva in the mouth, gastric juice in the stomach, bile, pancreatic juice and the
Succusentericus or the intestinal juice in the intestines act upon the particles of food during their
passage in the alimentary canal or digestive tube. Saliva acts upon starch. It converts it into sugar.
This action is further taken by pancreatic and intestinal juice, in the intestines. Bile acts upon fats.
Gastric juice and pancreatic juice act upon proteins. The whole thing is converted into a milky juice
called chyle. This chyle is absorbed by lacteal vessels and it is mixed with blood. The right side of

56

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

the heart contains impure blood. This impure blood is sent to the lungs for purification and after
being purified is brought back to the left side of the heart, and from there it is pumped through the
big artery aorta, throughout the body. In the capillaries the blood exudes as lymph and bathes and
nourishes the tissues and cells of the body, and the impure blood is carried back by veins to the right
side of the heart.

The waste products of food are carried along the large intestine which is six feet in length to
the rectum where it is retained as faecal matter. When the nervous impulse is carried to the rectum
from the defaecation centre in the spinal cord, it is discharged through the anus, the terminal
opening of the alimentary canal.

The kidneys, that are situated in the loins, on each side, eliminate the urine from the blood
and send it through two tubes called the ureters to the reservoir of urine called ‘bladder’. From the
bladder it is discharged through the urethra.

The nervous system consists of cerebrum of forebrain, cerebellum or hind brain, spinal cord
and the sympathetic nerves. There are various centres in the brain for hearing, seeing, tasting,
smelling, speaking, etc. The different impulses from the hands when a finger is stung by a scorpion
are carried through the sensory nerves to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to brain. Mind that
has taken its seat in the brain, reacts. It feels. An impulse travels from the spinal cord and thence
along the motor nerves to the hand. At once the hand is taken back from the scorpion. This is all
done in the twinkling of an eye. The sympathetic nerves supply the internal organs of the abdomen,
liver, spleen, heart, etc.

Now I will describe, how this vital fluid semen is manufactured. The two testes or seeds that
are located in the scrotal bag are called secretory glands. These cells of the testes have been
endowed with the peculiar property of securing semen drop by drop from the blood, just as the bees
collect honey in the honey comb. Then this fluid is taken by the two spermatic ducts or tubes to the
two small bags or reservoirs for the semen called Vesiculae Seminalis (seminal bags), one on each
side. Under excitement it is thrown out by small ducts called ejaculatory ducts into the portic
portion of urethra or urinary canal, where it is mixed with the prostatic juice, secreted by the
prostate glands. Who is the real Director of these internal organs? Who has created this subtle,
internal, magnanimous machinery? Are you not struck with awe and wonder, my dear friends,
when you think for a moment seriously about the Divine Grandeur and Divine Glory, that are
exhibited in the structure of these miraculous mechanisms, heart,
lungs, brain, etc? How
harmoniously do they work! Who converts food into blood? Who pumps the blood into the arteries?
It is He. Feel His indwelling presence. Pay your silent homage to Him. Glory, Glory, unto the Lord,
the Creator of this wonderful body, His own image, His own dwelling house, the Navadvarapuri,
the nine-gated city!

A diet that is conducive to the practice of Yoga and spiritual progress can be rightly termed
‘Yogic Diet’. Diet has intimate connection with the mind. The mind is formed out of the subtlest
portion of food. Sage Uddalaka instructs his son Svetaketu as follows: “Food when consumed
becomes threefold, the gross particles become excreta, the middling ones flesh and the fine ones the

Yogic Diet

57

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

mind.” Again you will find in the Chhandogya Upanishad: “By the purity of food one becomes
purified in his nature; by the purification of his nature he verily gets memory of the Self, and by the
attainment of the memory of the Self, all ties and attachments are severed.”

Diet is of three kinds, viz., Sattvic diet, Rajasic diet and Tamasic diet. Milk, fruits, cereals,
butter, tomatoes, cheese, spinach are Sattvic food-stuffs. They render the mind pure. Fish, eggs,
meat, etc., are Rajasic food-stuffs. They excite the passionate nature of man. Beef, onions, garlic,
etc., are Tamasic food stuffs. They fill the mind with inertia and anger. Lord Krishna says to Arjuna
in the Gita (XVIII: 8-10): “The food which is dear to each is threefold. Hear thou the distinction of
these. The foods which increase vitality, energy, vigour, health and joy and which are delicious,
bland substantial and agreeable are dear to the pure. The passionate man desires foods that are
bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and burning and which produce pain, grief and
disease. The food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten and impure is dear to the Tamasic.”

Food is of four kinds. There are liquids which are drunk; solids which are pulverised by the
teeth and eaten; some solids which are taken in by licking; and soft articles that are swallowed
without mastication. All articles of food should be thoroughly masticated in the mouth. Then only
they can be readily digested, easily absorbed and assimilated in the system.

The diet should be such as can maintain physical efficiency and good health. The well-being
of a man depends rather on perfect nutrition than on anything else. Various sorts of intestinal
diseases, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, lack of high vitality and power of
resistance, rickets, scurvy, anaemia or poverty of blood, beriberi, etc., are all due to faulty nutrition.
It should be remembered that it is not so much the climate, as food which plays a vital part in
producing a healthy strong man or a weakling suffering from a host of diseases. A knowledge of the
science of dietetics is essential for every man if he wants to keep up physical efficiency and good
health. He should be able to make out a cheap, well-balanced diet from certain articles of diet. Then
only all the members of his family will be hale and hearty. What is wanted is a well-balanced diet
but not a rich one. A rich diet produces diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas. A well-balanced diet
helps a man to grow, and turn out much work, increases his body weight and keeps up the efficiency
and a high standard of vigour and vitality. A man is what he eats. This is a truism indeed.

Food is required for two purposes: 1) to maintain our body-heat and 2) to produce new cells
and to make up for the wear and tear of our bodies. Foodstuffs contain proteins, carbohydrates,
hydrocarbons, phosphates, salt, various kinds of ashes, water, vitamins, etc. Protein substances are
nitrogenous. They build the tissues of the body. They are present in abundance in dal, milk, etc.
They are called ‘tissue-builders’. Proteins are complex organic compounds which contain carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen and sometimes sulphur, phosphorus and iron. Starches are
carbohydrates. They are present in abundance in rice. Carbohydrates are ‘energy-producers’ or heat
givers. Carbohydrates are substances, like starch, sugar or gum and contain carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen. Hydrocarbons or fats are present in ghee and vegetable oils. Fats are compounds of
glycerine with fatty acids. The human machine of the body necessarily needs lubrication. Butter,
cream, cheese, olive-oil, groundnut-oil, mustard-oil are good for lubrication.

A well-balanced diet is one in which the different principles of diet that go to keep the body
and mind in perfect health and harmony exist in proper proportions. Milk is perfect food, because it

58

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

contains all nutritious principles in proper well-balanced proportions. The protein, fat and
carbohydrate should be in right proportion. They should be of the right kind also. If a diet contains
too much of one thing or too little of another, if it is faulty in one way or the other by being deficient
or preponderating in one or more important constituents of food, then it is called an ill-balanced or
faulty diet. This will lead to malnutrition, stunted growth, physical deficiency, etc. Many diseases
take their origin from malnutrition. If the food is nutritious, wholesome and well-balanced, one has
good power of endurance and physical efficiency. If he has physical efficiency he can turn out more
work. Some take milk as an animal diet, while some others regard egg as vegetable diet. All these
people are under a delusion. Milk is a vegetable diet, while egg is an animal diet. This is the
emphatic declaration of learned sages. Yogic students should give up eggs. All the nutritive
principles are found in milk, butter, cheese, fruits, almonds, tomatoes, carrots and turnips.

The important digestive juices are saliva in the mouth, gastric juice in the stomach, and
pancreatic juice, bile and intestinal juice (succus entericus) in the small intestines. Saliva is
alkaline. It is secreted by the salivary glands. It digests starches. Gastric juice is acidic in reaction. It
contains hydrochloric acid. It is secreted by the gastric glands. It digests proteins. Pancreatic juice
digests starches, proteins and fats. It contains three kinds of digestive ferments. It is manufactured
by the pancreas. Bile is secreted by the liver. It digests fats. The food-stuffs are rendered into chyle
by the action of these digestive juices, which is absorbed by the lacteals of the small intestines.

Gluttons and epicureans cannot dream to get success in Yoga. He who takes moderate diet,
he who has regulated his diet can become a Yogi. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says to
Arjuna: “Verily Yoga is not for him who eateth too much, nor who abstaineth to excess, nor who is
too much addicted to sleep, nor even to wakefulness, Arjuna. Yoga killeth out all pain for him who
is regulated in eating and amusement, regulated in performing actions, regulated in sleeping and
waking” (Gita, VI: 16,17). Take pleasant, wholesome and sweet food half-stomachful, fill the
quarter-stomach with pure water and allow the remaining quarter free for expansion of gas. This is
moderate diet.

All articles that are putrid, stale, decomposed, fermented, unclean, twice-cooked, kept
overnight should be abandoned. The diet should be simple, light, bland, wholesome, easily
digestible and nutritious. He who lives to eat is a sinner but he who eats to live is a saint. The latter
should be adored. If there is hunger, food can be digested well. If you have no appetite do not take
anything; give rest to the stomach.

A good quantity of food overworks the stomach, induces capricious appetite and renders the
tongue fastidious. Then it becomes very difficult to please the tongue. Man has invented many
kinds of dishes just to satisfy his palate and has made his life very complex and miserable. He calls
himself a civilised and cultured man when he is really ignorant and deluded by the senses. His mind
gets upset when he cannot get his usual dishes in a new place. Is this real strength? He has become
an absolute slave of his tongue. This is bad. Be natural and simple in eating. Eat to live and do not
live to eat. You can be really happy and can devote much time to Yogic practices.

A Yogic student who spends his time in pure meditation only, wants very little food. One or
one and a half seer of milk and some fruits will suffice. But when he comes on the platform for work

59

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

he wants abundant nutritious food. A man who does immense labour (physical work) wants more
food.

Meat is not at all necessary for the keeping up of health. Meat-eating is highly deleterious to
health. It brings a host of ailments such as tape-worm, albuminuria and other diseases of the
kidneys. After all, man wants very little on this earth. Killing of animals for food is a great sin.
Instead of killing the egoism and the idea of ‘mine-ness’ ignorant people kill innocent animals
under the pretext of sacrifice to Goddess but it is really to satisfy their tongues and palates. Horrible!
Most inhuman! Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah. Ahimsa is the first virtue that a spiritual aspirant should
possess. We should have reverence for life. Lord Jesus says: “Blessed are the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy.” Lord Jesus and Mahavir shouted at the top of their voice: “Regard every living
being as thyself and harm no one.” The law of Karma is inexorable, unrelenting and immutable. The
pain you inflict upon another will rebound upon you and the happiness you radiate to another will
come back to you, adding to your happiness.

Dr. J. Oldfield, Senior Physician, Lady Margaret Hospital, writes: “Today there is the
chemical fact in the hands of all, which none can gainsay that the products of the vegetable kingdom
contain all that is necessary, for the fullest sustenance of human life. Flesh is an unnatural food, and
therefore, tends to create functional disturbances. As it is taken in modern civilisation, it is infected
with such terrible diseases (readily transferable to man), as cancer, consumption, fever, intestinal
worms, etc., to an enormous extent. There is little need for wonder that flesh-eating is one of the
most serious causes of the diseases that carry off ninety-nine out of every hundred people that are
born.”

Meat-eating and alcoholism are closely allied. The craving for liquor dies a natural death
when the meat diet is withdrawn. The question of birth-control becomes very difficult in the case of
those who take meat-diet. To them mind-control is absolutely impossible. Mark how the
meat-eating tiger is ferocious, and the cow, elephant, which live on vegetable matter are mild and
peaceful! Meat has a direct evil influence on the compartments of the brain. The last step in the
spiritual advancement is the giving up of meat-diet. The divine light will not descend if the stomach
is loaded with meat-diet. In large meat-eating countries cancer mortality is very high. Vegetarians
keep up the sound health till old age. Even in the West in the hospitals, doctors are now putting
patients on vegetable diet. They convalesce very quickly.

Pythagoras, the Grecian Sage, condemned meat diet as sinful food! Just hear what he says:
“Beware! O mortals, of defiling your bodies with sinful food! There are cereals, there are fruits
bending the branches down by their weight, and luxurious grapes on the vines. There are sweet
vegetables and herbs, which, the flame, digestive fire, can render palatable and mellow. Nor are you
denied milk nor fragrance of the aroma of the thyma flower, the bountiful earth offers you an
abundance of pure food and provides for meals obtainable without slaughter and bloodshed.”

If you want to stop taking mutton, fish, etc., just see with your own eyes the pitiable,
struggling condition at the time of killing sheep. Now mercy and sympathy will arise in your heart.
Then you will determine to give up flesh-eating. If you fail in this attempt, just change your
environments and live in a vegetarian hotel where you cannot get mutton and fish. Move in that
society where there is only vegetable diet. Always think of the evils of flesh-eating and the benefits

60

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

of a vegetable diet. If this also cannot give you sufficient strength to stop this habit, go to the
slaughter house and butcher’s shop and personally see the disgusting rotten muscles, intestines,
kidneys and other nasty parts of the animal, which emit bad smell. This will induce Vairagya in you
and a strong disgust and hatred towards meat-eating.

It is not only heinous but an atrocious crime to kill a cow or a goat which gives invaluable
milk, butter, etc. O self-deluded ignorant cruel man! do not kill these innocent beings. Terrible
torture awaits you on the day of judgment. You are morally responsible for all your acts. The law of
Karma is infallible. Killing of cows tantamounts to killing one’s own mother. What right have you
got to take away the lives of these innocent animals which give you milk to nourish your body? This
is a most brutal, inhuman, heart-rending act. The slaughter of cows, goats and other animals should
be immediately stopped by legislation. The animal that is taken for slaughter causes various sorts of
poisons in the blood on account of its fear and anger. The vegetarian diet can fully supply the
dietetic needs of the body. Therefore, such cruelties are unwarranted.

I shall speak a word now on vitamins. Vitamins are also required in the diet. They build the
bodies. If they are absent or deficient, the body cannot grow and deficiency diseases such as rickets,
scurvy, etc., result. They are present in very small quantities in foods. They are like a spark which
ignites the fire of nutrition. There are four important kinds of vitamins: Vitamin A, Vitamin B,
Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Vitamin A is present in milk. Vitamin B is present in the unpolished rice
and tomato juice. Deficiency of Vitamin B causes beriberi. Those who eat polished rice get this
disease. Vitamin C is found in vegetables, fruits and green leaves. This vitamin is destroyed by
cooking, tinning. Sailors suffer from scurvy, because they cannot get fresh vegetables and fruits
during long voyage. They generally take with them the juice of lemons. This prevents the
development of scurvy. Vitamin D is present in milk, butter, eggs, cod-liver oil, etc. Absence or
deficiency of vitamin D causes rickets in children.

Food is nothing but a mass of energy. Food supplies energy to the body and mind. If you can
draw this energy from your pure will, if you know the Yogic technique of absorbing the energy
directly from the sun or cosmic Prana, you can maintain the body with this energy and can dispense
with food altogether. The Yogi gets Kayasiddhi or perfection of the body.

If food is completely digestible it will produce constipation. Food should contain some
residue of fibres or husks which will form faecal matter. No water should be taken when digestion is
going on in the stomach. It will dilute the digestive juice and impair digestion. You can take a
glassful of water when you have finished your meals.

Where can Sannyasins who live on public alms get a well-balanced diet? They get on some
days pungent stuffs only, on some other days sweetmeats only, on some other days sour things only.
But they draw the required energy through the power of meditation. This unique, Yogic method is
unknown to the medical profession and scientists. Whenever the mind is concentrated, a divine
wave bathes all the tissues with the divine elixir. All the cells are renovated and vivified.

Fasting is interdicted for practitioners of Yoga as it produces weakness. Occasional mild
fast is highly beneficial. It will thoroughly overhaul the system, will give rest to the stomach and
intestines and eliminate uric acid. Yogic students can take one full meal at 11 O’clock, a cup of milk

61

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

in the morning and half a seer of milk and 2 bananas or 2 oranges or 2 apples at night. The night
meals should be very light. If the stomach is loaded, sleep will supervene. A diet consisting of milk
and fruits alone is splendid menu for students of Yoga.

Simple, natural, non-stimulating, tissue-building, energy-producing, non-alcoholic foods
and drinks keep the mind calm and pure and help one in Yogic practices and in the attainment of the
goal of life.

Sivananda’s Pranayama

Technique: Sit comfortably on a chair, sofa or easy-chair. Draw the air through both
nostrils, as long as comfortable. Retain as long as comfortable. Repeat your Ishta Mantra or ‘OM’
while retaining the breath. Then exhale as long as comfortable. You need not observe any ratio
between the inhalation, exhalation and retention; but let the inhalation and exhalation be deep and
full.

Benefit: The benefits of this Pranayama are incalculable. All the muscles are relaxed. All the
nerves are toned. Rhythm and harmony are established in the entire being. Mind is calmed.
Circulation is promoted. An inexpressible peace and bliss come to reign within you.

You can do it in the morning while lying in bed. Your mind will become alert for
commencing Japa and Dhyana. You can do it when the mind is about to lose balance on account of
the setting in of lust, anger or other evil Vrittis; the mind will he filled with a great power that will
prevent the evil Vrittis from disturbing it. You can do it just before commencing your study; the
mind will be concentrated easily and what you study will be indelibly impressed in your mind. You
can do it during your office-work; you will get new strength every time and you will never be tired.
When you return home from the office you can practise this Pranayama and you will be recharged
with fresh energy.

The greatest advantage is that once you start doing it you will do it very often; and your
mind can never find an excuse for not practising this Ati-Sukha-Purvaka Pranayama, very easy and
comfortable Pranayama which has all the advantages of Pranayama, without its ‘rules and
regulations’. Do it from now without fail.

Kundalini Pranayama

In this Pranayama, the Bhavana is more important than the ratio between Puraka,

Kumbhaka and Rechaka.

Sit in Padma or Siddha Asana, facing the East or the North.

After mentally prostrating to the lotus-feet of the Satguru and reciting Stotras in praise of
God and Guru, commence doing this Pranayama which will easily lead to the awakening of the
Kundalini. Inhale deeply, without making any sound.

62

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

As you inhale, feel that the Kundalini lying dormant in the Muladhara Chakra is awakened
and is going up from Chakra to Chakra. At the conclusion of the Puraka, have the Bhavana that the
Kundalini has reached the Sahasrara. The more vivid the visualisation of Chakra after Chakra, the
more rapid will be your progress in this Sadhana.

Retain the breath for a short while. Repeat the Pranava or your Ishta Mantra. Concentrate on
the Sahasrara Chakra. Feel that by the Grace of Mother Kundalini, the darkness of ignorance
enveloping your soul has been dispelled. Feel that your whole being is pervaded by light, power and
wisdom.

Slowly exhale now. And, as you exhale feel that the Kundalini Sakti is gradually

descending from the Sahasrara, and from Chakra to Chakra, to the Muladhara Chakra.

Now begin the process again.

It is impossible to extol this wonderful Pranayama adequately. It is the magic wand for
attaining perfection very quickly. Even a few days’ practice will convince you of its remarkable
glory. Start from today, this very moment.

My God bless you with joy, bliss and immortality.

Questions and Answers

Q. Is it right to say that Pranayama is unnecessary in the practice of Raja Yoga?

A. No; Pranayama forms one of the eight limbs of Raja Yoga.

Q. Is it dangerous to practise Pranayama without the assistance of a Guru (Teacher)?

A. People are unnecessarily alarmed. You can practise ordinary Pranayama exercises
without the help of a Guru. A Guru is necessary if you want to practise Kumbhaka or retention of
breath for long time and unite Apana with Prana. The books written by realised Yogins can guide
you if you are not able to get a Guru. But it is better to have a Guru by your side or you can get the
lessons from him and practise them at home. You can keep regular correspondence with him. You
can retain the breath from 1/2 to 1 or 2 minutes without any difficulty or danger. If you cannot get a
realised Yogi, you can approach senior students of Yoga. They also can help you.

Q. Will the practice of Pranayama alone awaken the sleeping Kundalini Sakti?

A. Yes. Asanas, Bandhas, Mudras, Japa, meditation, strong and pure irresistible analytical

will, the grace of Guru, devotion, all these also will awaken the Kundalini Sakti.

Q. What are the effects of the practice of Khechari Mudra?

63

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

A. It will help the student to stop the breath. He can have nice concentration and meditation.
He will be free from hunger and thirst. He can change the breath from one nostril to another quite
easily. He can have Kevala Kumbhaka also very easily.

Q. What are the symptoms when the Prana and Apana are united and when the Prana passes

in Sushumna?

A. When Prana and Apana are united, the united Prana-Apana will pass through the
Sushumna and the practitioner will become dead to the world, i.e., he will lose the consciousness of
his body, environments and the world but will have perfect awareness. He will feel Divine Thrill,
Divine Ecstasy and the experiences of the lower stages of Samadhi. When the Prana proceeds
higher in Sushumna, different kinds of experiences at different Chakras are felt by the practitioner
(which cannot be described but should be experienced). When the Prana reaches Sahasrara, the
Yogi attains Samadhi.

Q. Should one in the practice of Pranayama during Maha Bandha also maintain the

proportion 1:4:2?

A. Yes, in Maha Bandha the proportion for inhalation, retention and expiration is 1:4:2.

Q. If one practises Bandhatraya Pranayama and practises Puraka 10 Matras, Kumbhaka 40
Matras and Rechaka 20 Matras, how long must be the pure Kumbhaka and how long the expiratory
pause with Uddiyana?

A. In Bandhatraya, beginners need not have any expiratory pause. Advanced students can
have it for 5 or 6 seconds. In Bandhatraya, the main Kundalini (1:4:2) is quite sufficient for the
union of Prana and Apana.

Q. What is the difference between Tadana Kriya and Maha Vedha?

A. In Tadana Kriya one can breathe in any way. But Maha Vedha Pranayama should be

practised as described in Bandhatraya.

Q. Is Pranayama necessary for getting Darsana of the Lord?

Q. When the Prana is taken up to the tenth door (Brahmarandhra), on the crown of the head,

will the practitioner feel a pinprick ?

A. No.

A. No.

Q. What is Urdhvaretah Pranayama?

64

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

A. While doing Sukha-Purvaka or Loma-Viloma Pranayama one would feel that the Virya
is flowing up towards the Sahasrara at the crown of the head in the form of Ojas. This is
Urdhvaretah Pranayama.

Q. If I try to keep the ratio 1:4:2 when I practise Pranayama, I am not able to concentrate on

my Ishta Devata. If I try to concentrate I cannot keep up the ratio 1:4:2. Kindly advise what to do?

A. Try to keep the ratio for two or three months. A strong habit will be formed and the ratio
will be kept up automatically. Then you can concentrate on your tutelary deity. Mind can do only
one thing at a time.

Q. What is the object of inhaling through the left nostril and exhaling through the right

nostril and vice versa?

A. This will make the breath rhythmical, steady the nerves and the mind and allow the
Sushumna Nadi to flow, which will be beneficial for meditation. It will keep up a perfect harmony
in the system. The five Kosas will vibrate rhythmically.

Q. Can there be any dangerous result in the practice of Pranayama as some people think?

A. There is no danger in practising Pranayama, Asanas, etc, if you are careful, and if you use
your common-sense. People are unnecessarily alarmed. There is danger in everything, if you are
careless.

Q. I am regular in my Sadhana. The jerks still continue though they are not so frequent as

before. Kindly advise me on the matter?

A. Through the practice of Pranayama and meditation, the cells and tissues are vivified.
They are charged with new Prana. New Pranic currents are generated, These give rise to jerks in the
beginning. They will disappear soon.

Q. Will you be kind enough to elucidate ‘Apana Vayu’? We inhale air, thereby oxygen is
absorbed by blood-cells as well as plasma. But from that oxygen, how Apana is formed? In what
part it resides? What is the nature? How and where Prana and Apana unite? Kindly explain
scientifically mentioning parts affected thereby.

A. Apana is not formed from oxygen. Apana is energy. Apana resides in the lower part of
the abdomen, in the Muladhara, in the descending colon, rectum and anus. Its nature is downward
motion. Its function is ejection of urine, gas and excreta. Prana and Apana are united by Kevala
Kumbhaka, Kumbhaka, Muladhara, Jalandhara Bandha and Uddiyana Bandha. They are united in
the navel or Manipuraka Chakra.

Q. How is Nadi-Suddhi done?

A. The cleansing of the Nadi (Nadi-Suddhi) is either Samanu or Nirmanu—that is, with or
without the use of Bija. According to the first form, the Yogi in Padmasana or Siddhasana offers his

65

THE SCIENCE OF PRANAYAMA

prayers to his Guru and meditates on him. Meditation on ‘Yam’ (y:(cid:246)) he does Japa of the Bija 16
times through Ida, Kumbhaka with Japa of the Bija 64 times, and then exhalation through the solar
Nadi and Japa of Bija 32 times. Fire is raised from Manipura and united with Prithvi. Then
following inhalation by the solar Nadi with the Vahni Bija ‘Ram’ (r(cid:246)) 16 times, Kumbhaka with 64
times Japa of the Bija, followed by exhalation through the lunar Nadi and Japa of the Bija 32 times.
He then meditates on the lunar brilliance, gazing at the tip of the nose, and inhales by Ida with Japa
of Bija ‘Tham’ (Y(cid:246)) 16 times. Kumbhaka is done with the Bija ‘Vam’ (v:(cid:246)) 64 times. He thinks
himself as flooded by nectar, and considers that the Nadis have been washed. He exhales by Pingala
with 32 times Japa of the Bija ‘Lam’ (l:(cid:246)) and considers himself strengthened thereby.

If you are careless in getting down through the steps of a stair-case, you will fall down and
break your bones. If you are careless when you walk in the busy parts of a city, you will be crushed
by the motor-car. If you are careless when you purchase a ticket at the Railway Station, you will
lose your money-purse. If you are careless in dispensing mixtures you will kill the patients by
giving a poison or a wrong medicine or administering a medicine in overdoses. Even so, when you
practise Pranayama and other Yogic exercises you will have to be careful about your diet. You
should avoid overeating; you should take light, easily digestible and nutritious food. You should
not go beyond your capacity in retaining the breath, you should first practise inhalation and
exhalation only (without retention of breath) for one or two months. You should gradually increase
the ratio from 1:4:2 to 16:64:32, You should exhale very very slowly. If these rules are observed,
there will be no danger at all in the practice of Pranayama and other Yogic exercises.
