PUBLISHERS’ NOTE

Anger and lust are the two aides of Satan; and every religion has regarded these two as the
most powerful with which the sincere seeker after truth has to contend. Having dealt with the two
together in his play “PASSION AND ANGER.” Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj now gives us this
precious manual of practical methods to wage war against this dire enemy of man.

Those who know Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj, know that he is the best authority on the
subject of the conquest of anger: he has never known to lose his temper, even in circumstances in
which even the great might have lost theirs! Swami Sivananda insists that the adoption of positive
methods of soul-education would be more effective than punitive forms of reformation and
transformation. This he has demonstrated time and again in his attitude towards his own disciples at
the Ashram.

With his natural and extraordinary flair for practice, Sri Swamiji Maharaj has given in this
wonderful booklet, highly practical methods for the control of anger: and it is hoped that every
spiritual aspirant would make a thorough study of it and practice the precepts of the sage, so that,
thus established in ethical perfection, the Sadhaka would soon become a Siddha.

MEANING

BENEFITS

We worship the three-eyed One (Lord Siva) Who is fragrant and Who nourishes well all
beings; may He liberate us from death for the sake of immortality even as the cucumber is severed
from its bondage (to the creeper).

1. This Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is a life-giving Mantra. In these days, when life is very
complex and accidents are an everyday affair, this Mantra wards off death by snake-bite, lightning,
motor-accidents, fire-accidents, cycle-accidents, water-accidents, air-accidents and accidents of all
descriptions. Besides, it has a great curative effect. Again diseases pronounced incurable by doctors
are cured by this Mantra, when chanted with sincerity, faith and devotion. It is a weapon against
disease. It is a Mantra to conquer death.

2. It is also a Moksha Mantra. It is Lord Siva’s Mantra. It bestows long life (Deergha Ayus),
peace (Santi), wealth (Aisvarya), prosperity (Pushti), satisfaction (Tushti) and Immortality
(Moksha).

3. On your birthday, repeat one lakh of this Mantra or at least 50,000, perform Havan and

feed Sadhus, the poor and the sick. This will bestow on you long life, peace and prosperity.

4. Kindly consecrate one Mala or more daily to Sri Swami Sivanandaji!

Arjuna said:— Impelled by what, does man commit sin, much against his wishes, O

Varshneya, compelled as it were, by force? Gita Ch: III-36.

The Blessed Lord said:— It is desire, it is anger born of the Rajo-Guna, all devouring, all

sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world). Gita Ch. III-37.

The cause of sin or wrong action in this world is desire. Anger is only a modification or form
of desire. Anger is desire itself. When a desire is not gratified the man becomes angry against those
who stand as obstacles in the path of fulfilment. The desire is born of the quality of Rajas. When
desire arises, it generates Rajas and urges the man to work in order to possess the object. Therefore
know that this desire is man’s foe on this earth.

Lust, anger and greed,—these highway robbers will cause a man to fall into the dark abyss
of hell, misery and grief. These are the three fountain-heads of misery. These three constitute the

knowledge.

From anger comes delusion, from delusion the loss of memory; from loss of memory the

He who is able to resist the force of desire and anger even before he quits his body—he is a

Yogin, he is a blessed man. Gita Ch. V-23.

Those who are free from desire and anger, and who have subdued their minds and realised

themselves—around such austere men lies the beatitude of God. Gita Ch. V-26.

CONQUEST OF ANGER

ANGER AND ITS FORMS

Anger is a negative Vritti or whirlpool in the mind-lake. It is born of ignorance.

It is a strong emotion, excited by a real or fancied injury and involving a desire for

retaliation.

Anger is the natural passion or emotion of displeasure and antagonism aroused by injury or
insult, real or imagined, and directed against the cause thereof. Anger arises from an idea of evil
having been inflicted or threatened.

Anger is often accompanied by a desire to take vengeance, or to obtain satisfaction from the

offending party.

It begins in folly and ends in repentance.

There fire you kindle for your enemy burns yourself.

When anger arises, think of the consequences. It will soon subside.

You think of objects of senses. Attachment to these objects develops. From attachment
desire is born. From desire anger comes forth. From anger proceeds delusion; from delusion
confused memory; from confused memory the destruction of reason; from destruction of reason
you perish.

Raga or attachment is a long-standing associate of anger.

Control anger through patience, enquiry, self-restrained love and meditation. This is manly

and divine. This is wise and glorious.

To become angry for trifling things is mean childish and brutal.

An angry man is angry with himself when he comes to his senses.

Anger is personal and usually selfish, aroused by real or supposed wrong to oneself.
Indignation is impersonal and unselfish displeasure at unworthy acts. Pure indignation is not
followed by regret and needs no repentance. It is also more self-controlled than anger. Anger is
commonly a sin. Indignation is often a duty. We speak of “righteous” indignation.

Raga drives one beyond the bounds of prudence of discretion. Fury is stronger and sweeps

one away into uncontrollable violence.

Wrath is deep and vengeful displeasure. It simply expresses the culmination of righteous

indignation without malice in a pure being.

3

ANGER AND ITS FORMS

Anger is a stronger term than resentment, but not so strong as “indignation” which is
awakened by what is flagitious in character or conduct, nor as wrath, fury, rage in which anger is
wrought up to a still higher point in the order of these words. Anger is a sudden sentiment of
displeasure, resentment is a continued anger, wrath is a heightened sentiment of anger.

PHILOSOPHY OF ANGER

It will be admitted on all hands that everyone without any exception whatsoever, is a victim
of this horrible malady. Indeed control of anger will bring in its train supreme peace and
immeasurable joy. As such, let me presently describe in detail what anger is, its various forms, how
it affects the nervous system, its exact relationship with passion and lastly the various practical
methods that can be safely employed to effectively eradicate it—root and branch. My one fervent
appeal to you all is that, you will apply yourselves heart and soul to the eradication of this dire
disease by following these valuable practices.

Anger is a Vritti or modification that arises in the mind-lake when the Gunas—Rajas and
Tamas—predominate. It is Rajo-Guna Vritti. Some take it as a Tamo-Guna Vritti. It is a wave of
unpleasant feeling that arises from the Antahkarana, when one gets displeased with another. It is in
other words, a modification of desire or passion. Just as milk is changed into curd, so also desire
becomes changed into anger. It is the most formidable enemy of peace, knowledge and devotion. It
is the straightest road to hell itself.

Anger is a manifestation of Sakti or Devi. In “Chandipath” or “Durga Sapta-Sati” you will
find: “Ya Devi sarvabhuteshu krodharupena samsthita, namastasyai namastasyai narnastasyai
namo namah.—I bow again and again to that Devi who is seated in all beings in the form of anger.”

It was Arjuna who asked Sri Krishna: “But what impels man to commit sin, O Krishna, in
spite of himself and driven as it were, by force?” The blessed Lord said: “Kama esha krodha esha
rojoguna-samudbhavah, Mahasano mahapapma vidhyena-miha vairinam. Dhumenavriyate
vahniryathaadarso malena cha, Yathodbenavrito garbhah tatha tenedamavritam—It is desire, it is
wrath, which, springs from passion. Know that it is our enemy here, a monster of greed and sin. As a
flame is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an unborn babe by the womb, so is this
enveloped by that.” Gita: Ch. III-37&38. Then again says Sri Krishna: “Trividham narakasyedam
dwaram nasanamatmanah kamahkrodhastatha lobhastasma-detattrayam tyajet—Three are the
gateways of this hell leading to the ruin of the soul—lust, wrath and greed. Therefore let man
renounce these three.” Gita Ch. XVI-21

Anger resides in the Linga Sarira (astral body), but it percolates into the physical body just
as water percolates through the pores to the outer surface of an earthen pot. Just as heat melts lead,
just as heat and borax melt gold, so also Kama and Krodha—the heating factors of the mind—melt
the mind.

Anger begets eight kinds of vices. All evil qualities and actions proceed from anger. If you
can eradicate anger, all bad qualities will die by themselves. The eight vices are; injustice, rashness,
persecution, jealousy, taking possession of others’ property, killing, harsh words and cruelty.

CONQUEST OF ANGER

When a man’s desire is not gratified and when someone stands in the way of its fulfilment,
the man becomes angry. The desire gets transformed into anger. When one is under the sway of
anger, he will commit all sorts of sinful deeds. He loses his memory, his understanding becomes
clouded and his intellect gets perverted.

“Krodhat bhavati sammohah sammohat smriti-vibhramah: Smritibhramsat buddhinaso

buddhinasat pranasyati.”

“From anger comes delusion, from delusion, the loss of memory; from loss of memory, the

destruction of discrimination; from destruction of discrimination he perishes.”

Anger is the greatest enemy. Contentment is the Nandana garden (the heavenly flower of
Indra) and peace is the Kamadhenu. Therefore, take to forgiveness. Atman is different from the
body, the Indriyas, Prana and the intellect. It is self-effulgent, unchangeable, pure and formless.

An angry man commits murder. He himself does not know what he is exactly doing. He
becomes emotional and impulsive. A man when he is angry will talk anything. He will do anything
he likes. A hot word results in fighting and stabbing. He is under intoxication. He loses his normal
consciousness for the time being. He falls a prey to anger.

Irritation, frowning, resentment, indignation, rage, fury, wrath are all varieties of anger,
according to the degree of intensity. If a man wants to correct another man and manifests slight
anger unselfishly, as a force to check and improve him, then it is called “righteous indignation” or
“spiritual anger.” Suppose a man molests a woman and tries to outrage her modesty and a bystander
becomes angry with the criminal, it is called “righteous indignation” or “noble rage.” This is not
bad. Only when the anger is the outcome of greed, of selfish motives, it is bad. Sometimes a
religious teacher has to manifest a little anger outwardly to correct his disciples. This is not bad. He
has to do it. But he should be cool within and hot and impetuous without. He should not allow the
anger to take deep root in his Antahkarana for a long time. It should pass off the next moment even
as a wave subsides in the sea.

If a man becomes irritable for trifling things very often, it is a definite sign of mental
weakness. When a man abuses you, and when a man takes away your cloth or coat, if you keep
quiet, that is a positive sign of inner strength. Self-restraint, or self-control is a sign of great mental
strength. An easily irritable man is always unjust. He is swayed by impulses and emotions.

Anger gains strength by repetition. If it is checked then and there, man gains immense
strength of will. When anger is controlled, it becomes transmuted into spiritual energy that can
move the three worlds. Just as heat or light is changed into electricity, so also anger becomes
changed into Ojas. Energy takes another form. Energy is wasted enormously when one gets angry.
The whole nervous system is shattered by an outburst of anger. The eyes become red, the body
quivers, the legs and hands tremble. No one can check an angry man. He gets enormous strength for
the time being and gets a collapse after sometime on account of reaction.

Instances are recorded wherein women have killed their children by nursing them with
breast-milk when they were in a fit of anger. Various poisons are thrown into the blood when one is

PHILOSOPHY OF ANGER

angry. Fiery dark arrows shoot out from the astral body. These can be seen clearly by clairvoyant
eye. In the light of modern psychology, all diseases take their origin in anger. Rheumatism,
heart-disease, nervous disease are all due to anger. It takes some months for the restoration of
normal equilibrium in the nervous system.

Passion is the root and anger the stem. You will have to destroy the root (passion) first. Then
the stem (anger) will die by itself. A passionate man is more angry. A Brahmachari who has
preserved his Veerya always keeps a balanced mind. He has a cool brain at all times.

The root cause of anger is ignorance and egoism. Through Vichara (right enquiry), egoism
should be removed. Then alone can one control his anger completely. Through development of the
opposite virtues such as Kshama, love, Santi, Karuna, friendship, etc., anger can be controlled to an
enormous degree. The force can be reduced. Atma-jnana alone can fry all Samskaras of anger and
eradicate it in toto.

If an aspirant has controlled anger, half of his Sadhana is over. Control of anger means
control of lust also. Control of anger is really control of mind. He who has controlled anger cannot
do any wrong or evil action. He is always just. It is very difficult to say when a man will be thrown
into a fit of fury. All of a sudden he gets an irresistible fit of anger for trifling matters. When anger
assumes a grave form, it becomes difficult to control. It should therefore, be controlled even when it
is in the form of a small ripple in the subconscious mind (Chitta). One should watch his mind very,
very cautiously. Whenever there is the least symptom or indication of light irritability, then and
there it must be nipped. Then it becomes very easy to control anger. Be careful and vigilant and
watch the ripple, then only you are a sage.

Whenever there is a little irritability, stop all conversation and observe Mouna (the vow of
silence). Practice of Mouna daily for one or two hours is of great help in controlling anger. Always
try to speak sweet soft words. The words must be soft and the arguments hard; but if the reverse is
the case it will lead to discord and disharmony. There is a sharp sword in every tongue.

If you find it difficult to control anger, leave the place at once and take a brisk walk. Drink
some cold water immediately. This cools down the body and mind. Chant ‘OM’ loudly like a lion
for ten minutes and then chant ‘OM SANTI’ mentally or verbally for five minutes.

Think of the picture of your Ishtam. Pray. Repeat your Ishta Mantra for ten minutes.

Gradually the anger will vanish.

Find out the real cause of your anger and try to eradicate it. If a man abuses you and calls you
names, you become furious at once. Your blood becomes hot. Why do you feel offended when he
calls you ‘a dog’ or ‘a donkey’? Have you developed now four legs and tail like a dog? Why do you
get excited for little things? Enquire: What is this abuse? Is it not mere vibration in the ether? Am I
body or Atman? No one can injure Atman. The Atman of the abuser and the abused is one. Do I
really gain anything by retaliating? I waste my energy. I hurt the feeling of another man. I disturb
and pollute the thought world. I do real harm to the world by sending a current of hatred. This world
is unreal. I will live here for a short time only. Let me bear this insult. Let me excuse him. I will
develop inner mental strength and power of endurance. You can thus very effectively eradicate the

6

CONQUEST OF ANGER

feelings of anger. A time will come when you will not be irritated even a bit by harsh words, abuses
and insults, of this kind. You will not pay the least heed if a man says that such and such a man has
said bad words against you. You will simply laugh the whole matter away. An irritable man is very
weak and has no mental strength.

You must try to remain cool even in the most provocative conditions. If you are hungry and
if you suffer from any disease, you generally become more irritable. If you have some troubles,
difficulties or loss, you get irritated for little things. If a Sannyasi who lives in the cave says that he
has controlled anger, you cannot believe him. The waves are for the time being suppressed. There
are no opportunities for his getting irritated. If some transactions take place, if he is ill-treated, he
will again manifest his anger. The world is a better training college for the control of anger.

An aspirant should direct all his attention towards the conquest of this powerful enemy.
Sattvic food, Japa, regular meditation, prayer, Satsanga, service, Vichara, Kirtan, practice of
Pranayama and Brahmacharya—all are some of the most potent factors that pave a long way in
eradicating this dire malady. A combined method should be adopted in its eradication. Smoking,
meat-eating and drinking of liquors make men very irritable. Therefore, these should be completely
abandoned. Be careful in the choice of your company. Give up the companionship of evil
characters. Talk little. Mix little. Plunge yourself into the spiritual Sadhana. Develop Kshama
(forgiveness), Visva Prema (cosmic love), Karunya (mercy) and Nirabhimanata (absence of
egoism).

Meditate in the morning on the virtue of patience for ten minutes. Reflect and repeat the
formula ‘OM PATIENCE’ mentally several times daily. Remember the saints and their lives. Say
unto yourself: “I am patient now. I will never get irritated from today. I will manifest the virtue of
patience in my daily life. I am getting better and better.” Feel that you possess a magazine of
patience. Think of the advantages of possessing this virtue and the disadvantages of irritability. You
may fail many times but you will develop patience gradually and become an embodiment of
patience.

“He who is able to resist the force of desire and anger even before he quits his body—he is a

Yogin, he is a blessed man.” (Gita Ch. V-23)

“Those who are free from desires and anger and who have subdued their minds and realised

themselves—around such austere men lies the beatitude of God.” (Gita Ch. V-26)

Do not identify yourself with the Vritti of anger. When a wave of anger arises in the
mind-lake, stand as a witness of the Vritti. Become indifferent. Say unto yourself: “I am witness of
this modification. I am distinct from this Vritti. I have nothing to do with this wave.” Then this
Vritti will die by itself. It will not disturb you. Identification with the Vritti is the cause of human
sufferings. Identify yourself with the Self. Stand like a lion, as a spectator of the mental menagerie.

Live in the spirit of the above two Slokas. Eradicate anger. Manifest inner spiritual strength.
Realise Satchidananda Atman. Glory unto those who have rooted out their anger and attained
knowledge of the Self!

ANGER: MORE POWERFUL THAN DESIRE

ANGER: MORE POWERFUL THAN DESIRE

It is usual to regard Anger as a corollary or counterpart of desire, since it usually appears
when desire becomes frustrated. Psychologically, the two are interrelated. Yet from the point of
view of the spiritual Sadhaka whose main task is to purify the mind, anger is a more powerful foe
than desire. It is worthwhile analysing the cause of the defeat too frequently sustained by the
Sadhaka when he wages war with anger.

First, it has to be remembered that the Sadhaka has to carry the fight all alone and unaided.
In this encounter with Kama, he has the co-operation of Society. Public opinion bears the brunt of
the warfare. If he reveals his Kama in its objectionable form he falls in the estimation of those
whose good opinion he values. To be calumniated by his detractors is wounding to his vanity. To be
reproved by his friends is painful. To be thought ill of even by those towards whom he is indifferent
is displeasing to him. All these thoughts are positive aids in carrying out his mental fight with
Kama. Far different is his condition when he attempts to conquer anger. Exhibition of temper is not
regarded as a moral delinquency by the public. Provocation is put forth as an excuse and
justification for reprehensible outbursts of anger, and is accepted as a mitigatory plea by the
indulgent public. Society seems to stand still with folded arms when an angry person frets, fumes or
raves. It would appear that ‘society’ even goes to the enemy’s camp and goads it (anger) to strike
harder and harder so as to thoroughly overpower the lonely victim. Not infrequently are found a
good many who irritate an already angry man merely for the fun of seeing him infuriated. Men are
so callous by nature that they are pleased when gazing upon the antics of a lunatic, and the
difference between an angry person and a maniac is only one of degree. The result is that the
spiritual Sadhaka, when assailed by his arch enemy anger, is too often overpowered.

Secondly, there operate certain sentiments which put on the cloak of virtues and misguide
the unwary spiritual pilgrim. One such is named self-respect. Forgetful of the fundamental truth
that the aspirant should be indifferent alike to praise and censure, he takes his stand on
self-respect—after all a slippery and unreliable foothold—and in his over-anxiety to protect it, fails
to notice the stealthy approach of his foe anger, till it is too late. ‘Love of country.’ ‘Duty to one’s
own wife and children’, ‘solicitude for the needy and the poor’ are all wrongly regarded as
justification for getting angry. Whatever may be the value of these sentiments from the point of
view of the community or the nation, they should not cloud the understanding of the spiritual
Sadhaka, whose one and only aim should be to conquer his mind.

Anger, like fever, is a symptom which shows that something has gone wrong in the inner
mechanism. The mental machinery gets heated for want of timely lubrication. The most effective of
all lubricants is Introspection or Reflection. Even the most angry man realises his folly after his
anger is spent out. It is then that he begins to reflect upon what he did. If this reflection had come to
him before he got angry, he would not have got angry at all. But that would be possible only if he
had made reflection or introspection over his habit. The habit must be formed in good time if the
evil is to be averted.

CONQUEST OF ANGER

CAUSE OF ANGER

Anger makes everybody its slave and victim. It breaks the friendship of even very intimate
friends. It even induces wives to quarrel with their husbands and make them file suits. It excites all.
It holds sway more or less over the whole world and the Devatas also.

Anger destroys reason and makes man do things which cannot be dreamt of. Under the
influence of anger man abuses, insults and even murders his father, brother, wife, Guru or king and
repents afterwards.

Anger influenced even Hanuman the mightiest Brahmachari to burn Lanka. He lost his
understanding and then repented “Alas! I have burnt the whole of Lanka under the influence of
anger. This fire might have burnt Mother Sita also. What shall I do now? How can I return without
Janaki Devi? I became a victim to anger. How powerful is anger? I am a powerful Brahmachari. I
have destroyed passion to its very root and branch and yet I have not controlled anger. How
powerful it is! It is more powerful than passion.”

Too much loss of semen is the chief cause of irritability and anger. Passion is the root and
anger the stem. You will have to destroy the root (passion) first, then the stem (anger) will die by
itself. A passionate man is more angry. A man who has wasted his seminal energy becomes irritated
soon for little things even. A Brahmachari who has preserved his Veerya always keeps a balanced
mind. He has a cool brain at all times.

Eradicate anger. Manifest inner spiritual strength. Realise Satchidananda Atman. Glory

unto those who have rooted out their anger and attained knowledge of the Self!

HINTS FOR CONTROL OF ANGER

1. Be alert. Pray. Do more Japa. Practise Vichara. Keep a watch over your mind. Be silent.
Observe Mouna daily for an hour. Forget and forgive. Bear insult and injury. Observe
Brahmacharya.

2. See God in all. Submit to God’s will. Then you cannot get angry.

3. In the morning meditate on the virtue of patience. Manifest it during the day. Take a vow

‘I will practise endurance and Kshama (forgiveness) during the day’.

4. Speak sweetly. Speak little.

5. Mix little. Have congenial company. Have Satsanga. Read spiritual books.

6. Remember the lives of saints like Ekanath, the Avanti Brahmin of the llth Skandha of the

Bhagavata. You will derive inspiration. You will develop love and Kshama.

7. Give up intoxicating liquors, meat and tobacco.

9

HINTS FOR CONTROL OF ANGER

8. Remember the Gita Slokas describing anger as monster and gate to hell. (Ch. III-37 and

Ch. XVI-21).

9. If you find it difficult to control anger, leave the place at once. Take a long walk. Drink
cold water. Repeat ‘Om Santi’ l0 times. Do Japa of your Ishta Mantra or count from 1 to 30. Anger
will subside.

10. Stand as a witness of the Vritti of anger. Be indifferent to it. Do not identify yourself

with it. Identify yourself with the Atman. Fill the mind with ideas of love, joy, etc.

11. Develop patience to a considerable extent. People lose their temper when they become
impatient. Allow the mind to dwell constantly on the opposite of anger, the virtue of patience. This
is the Pratipaksha Bhavana, method of Raja Yogins.

12. Do not give vent to anger. Control the body first. Have physical control. Practise this
again and again. Be regular in your Japa and meditation and Kirtan. This will give you great inner
spiritual strength.

13. Food has a great deal to do with irritability. Take milk, fruits, Moong-ki-dall, curd,
take carrots, onion, garlic, cauliflower,

spinach, barley, groundnuts, butter milk. Do not
Massoor-ki-dall and drumstick.

14. Observe Mouna for two hours daily. Occasionally observe Mouna for a whole day. This
will put a check on the impulse of speech. When a man gets excited, he speaks anything and
everything. He has no control over the organ of speech.

15. Prana entwines the mind like a creeper. Pranayama leads to the control of mind.
Pranayama will put a break on the impulse of speech. It will give you abundant energy to check
anger.

16. Do not argue much. Do not retort. Speak sweetly always. Do not use abusive words.
Become a man of measured words. If a man abuses or insults you, keep quiet. Identify yourself with
Atman. Atman is the same in all. It can never be hurt or insulted.

17. A Vedantin denies the body and mind as illusory sheaths. He does Vichara, enquires,
‘who am I’ and practises ‘Neti-neti’ ‘not this, not this’. ‘I am not body’. ‘I am not mind’.
‘Chidanandarupah Sivoham’. ‘I am blissful Siva or Atman.’ He identifies himself with Brahman or
Atman, the Eternal. The world is unreal for him. He chants OM, sings OM and does Japa of OM and
meditates on OM and derives soul-power and spiritual strength.

18. If you entertain Mithya Drishti, Dosha Drishti, if you look into the defects of anger and

the benefits of patience, you will never become angry.

19. The combined method is more effective. If one method fails, take recourse to the

combined method. Do Japa, Pranayama. Sometimes do Vichara.

SONG OF ANGER

Anger is very powerful; it can destroy all Tapas.
It subdued Durvasa. It conquered Yajnavalkya.
It is the enemy of peace. It is the foe of knowledge.
It is born of Rajo-Guna; irritability is another form.
It is all-devouring. It is all powerful.
It is the gate of the hell. It destroys the Atmic Pearl.
When desire is not gratified, it manifests in the mind-lake.
It makes the Jiva senseless, it makes him do all Adharmas.
It makes him more furious. It makes him its slave.
It makes him perfectly blind. It makes him lose his understanding.

Anger Has Its Raison D’etre

If there is no desire
There will be no activity;
The whole world will come to a standstill.
But you will have to convert all desires
Into one strong desire, Mumukshutva.
Anger has its usefulness.
Mother punishes the child for its correction.
A king punishes the criminal for his correction. Anger gives protection.
Convert Moha into attachment for God.
Convert greed for money into generosity and charity.
You will be elevated.

Forms Of Hatred

Jealousy is hatred
Anger is hatred
Ghrina is hatred
Irshya is hatred
Asuya is hatred
Amarsha is hatred
Remove hatred through love,
Prayer, Japa, service and meditation.

Anger acts as a boomerang
Because it injures the man
Who becomes angry.
It comes back to the angry man
And does harm to him.
Therefore control anger

Ill-Effects Of Anger

Anger is born of ignorance.
Anger is a modification of desire.
Anger arises from avarice, selfishness.
Anger arises when one is insulted, abused, criticised,
When his defects are pointed out.
Anger springs when a desire
Is not gratified.
Anger comes when someone
Stands in the way
Of gratifying one’s desire.
Anger manifests from loving
One’s own opinion.
From desiring to be honoured
From imagining that, one
Is wiser and superior than everybody.
Anger obstructs reason
Anger clouds understanding
And poisons the blood, nerves and the whole system.
Annihilate anger through love, forgiveness, enquiry, devotion, discrimination.
Wisdom, prayer, service, Sattvic food.
Selflessness, desirelessness,
Japa, meditation, Nitya-Drishti,
Dosha-Drishti and Tanmaya-Drishti.

DIALOGUE ON ANGER

Anger: I will make the people blind and deaf. I will overpower them with wrath and
suffocate them with rage. I will catch hold of even wise men. They shall neither hearken to what
concerns their own happiness, nor reflect what they had read in the scriptures.

Instigated by me, Indra killed Vritra, the son of Tvashtra; Lord Siva cut off the head of
Brahma; the Kaushika killed the sons of Vasishtha. In a moment I can destroy even the learned, the
famous, those who are attentive to duties, charitable and the mighty potentates.

I can infuse fury, resentment, wrath, indignation into the minds of all in the twinkling of an
eye. I am very powerful. I will disturb the Tapas of the aspirant and even Yogis and destroy
serenity.

The Jiva: Alas, who will help me now?

Kshama: I will. I will pull out the venomous tooth of this demon, Anger.

Visva Prema: I will. And I am the water to quench the fire of anger.

Viveka: I will. When I rise, anger dies.

THE STORY OF A SADHU WHO HAD CONTROLLED ANGER

This is the Kutir of the famous Santananda. See the colourful board proclaims: THIS IS
THE ABODE OF SANTANANDA WHO HAS ACQUIRED COMPLETE MASTERY OVER
ANGER. “Come, let us have the Darshan of such a Mahatma,” said a pious man to his friend.

“Oh, no, it is not so easy to control anger. Don’t be deceived. What will you gain by the
Darshan of this proud man who advertises his angerlessness? If you wish, you can go in and have
the Darshan of the great soul! But, please stay there till the evening; and then tell me if you would
still admire the divine soul. I am off.” And he went away.

When the pious soul entered the Kutir, little did he know that his friend had set out to collect

Instigators of Irritation.

“Maharaj,” said the pious man prostrating himself to the Mahatma, “what a great and divine
soul you are to have acquired mastery over this formidable foe of man, Anger. There is no one in the
three worlds equal to you.”

“Even so it is, my friend. The man who has conquered anger is greater than Brahma, Rudra

and Indra; for even they were often overpowered by anger.”

“Maharaj, will you kindly tell me the way to control anger?”

“O yes, gladly. Kindly remain with me and serve me. Even by such service of Mahatmas,

you will get over anger.”

And, the pious man became the Mahatma’s disciple.

Another young man entered: “Maharaj, you are the Mahatma who has controlled anger?”

“O yes, did you not see the board outside?”

“Yes, yes, please tell me how you managed to do that.”

“By my strong will-power. There is nothing that a man of strong will-power will not be able

to do.

“Wonderful. Thank you.” The young man leaves the cottage.

Almost instantly another young man enters. “Maharaj, have you controlled anger?”

“O yes, did you not see the board outside?”

13

THE STORY OF A SADHU WHO HAD CONTROLLED ANGER

“Yes, yes, please tell me how you managed to do that.”

“By meditation on the all-pervading Immortal Santa Atman that dwells in all beings. When
one Self alone pervades all, how can one be angered against another, how can one abuse another,
and how can one harm or injure another? Through protracted meditation on this great truth I have
got over this anger which destroys the peace of man.”

“Wonderful. Thank you.” The young man leaves the cottage.

Instantly another young man appears.

“Maharaj, have you completely annihilated anger?”

“O yes, did you not see the board outside?”

“Yes, yes, Maharaj. But how did you manage to do that?”

“Come, sit down. I will tell you. You see passion and anger are the twin children of Rajo
Guna. Now if you persistently and diligently cultivate Sattva in you, you can completely eradicate
these Rajasic qualities! I ate Sattvic food. I always entertained Sattvic thoughts. I uttered Sattvic
words, full of love, truth, solicitude and kindness. I practised Sattvic Tapas. I performed Sattvic
charity. I always studied scriptural texts which increased the Sattva in the mind. I live and move
constantly in Sattvic atmosphere. Through Pranayama also I have increased the Sattvic content of
my mind. Friend, it is a long and hard struggle. But at last I have achieved the goal. I have attained
success in my Sadhana. I am an embodiment of Sattva now. I am full of love; anger has vanished.”

“Wonderful, Thank you.” The young man leaves the cottage.

At once another man enters.

“Maharaj, have you controlled anger?”

“O yes, did you not see the board outside?”

“Yes, yes, but I want to know how you achieved it.”

“I wish to go out to answer calls of nature. But never mind, my duty towards you, my own
Self, is more important. I will tell you the secret. You see; anger has various forms. You are fully
aware of the grossest form. The blood boils; the eyes are blood shot! There is great heat in the body;
limbs tremble; lips quiver; fists are clenched; and the man stammers and fumbles for words in great
fury.

The subtler form of irritability you know about. In a milder form all the symptoms I have
just described exist here also. Still subtler is displeasure. It is pride mixed with anger. With a sharp
word or a grunt, you dismiss the ‘nuisance’. These are all forms of anger. In extremely subtle forms,
anger becomes righteous indignation and pity. The man who thinks that he is always in the right,

14

CONQUEST OF ANGER

gives vent to what he calls righteous indignation in order to protect Dharma. If he does not, he, in
the lordly style pities the person who has offended him. “Now I have got over and beyond all these
forms of anger. Even the Sattvic righteous indignation and pity do not trouble me now. I first
controlled the gross forms of anger. The anger arose in mind and it subsided there itself. Then by
meditation I controlled these subtle ripples of irritability. By the diligent cultivation of a feeling of
oneness I got over the displeasure—form of anger. I cultivated indifference towards wicked people
and thereby got over the out-bursts of righteous indignation and pity. Now I shine as Santananda
radiating peace and happiness to all.”

“Thank you, Maharaj, wonderful.” The young man leaves, crossing the next at the
threshold. Santanandaji rose from his seat and once more attempted to leave the hall when the next
young man accosted him. “Maharaj, just a minute. Have you controlled anger?”

In a slightly raised voice Santanandaji said: “Yes, why do you ask that question? Have you

not seen the board outside?”

“Yes, Maharaj. But I want to know how I can do that.”

“I will tell you. Drink a glass of cold water when you find your temper rising. Or count from

one to twenty. Or, leave the place at once.”

And Santanandaji tried to leave the hall along with the young man when the next one rushed

in.

“Maharaj, have you controlled anger, and how?”

Visibly affected by this annoyance. “Only to avoid this constant repetition of the truth, I

have announced it on the board outside. I have told the methods also to a number of people.”

“But I want to hear from your holy lips.”

“All right. Observe Mouna: You will be able to control anger."

“Thank you, Maharaj.”

“Look here,” said Santanandaji addressing the pious man who came first and who had been
watching all these proceedings, “see that no one enters the Kutir for some time till I answer calls of
nature, bathe and have my food and rest.”

“Maharaj, if I begin to prevent them, they will quarrel with me and I will lose my temper. I

won’t do that. I want to be your true disciple.”

At once another young man rushed inside, “Maharaj, you have completely eradicated anger:

And how?”

15

THE STORY OF A SADHU WHO HAD CONTROLLED ANGER

Santanandaji, addressing the first disciple; “Please ask him to go away. I have to answer

calls of nature urgently.”

“But won’t you share your secrets with me, Maharaj?” pleaded the latest arrival.

“I won’t drive him out. Why should I lose my temper?” said the first disciple.

“I will kick both of you out of my house,” roared Santananda. “Good-for-nothing young
man troubling me the whole day, without letting me have a few moments respite. What do you think
I am? A gramophone-box or a radio-receiving set? I have told you once and more than once that I
have got over anger. And these people come again and again to trouble me. Get out all of you and
see me no more. If you stay here for a minute more I will murder you. Here take this and get out if
you don’t believe that I have the strength to handle you.” He slaps the two young men, drives them
out and locks the door.

Outside, the pious man’s friend was waiting. “Have you had the Darshan of the great
Mahatma who has controlled anger? Are you satisfied?" said he to the pious man who went in to
have the Mahatma’s Darshan. “It is not so easy to control anger. It can be controlled only through
God’s Grace. Continuous practice of humility is necessary. Ego must be crushed. Cosmic love must
be cultivated. Selfless service must be ceaselessly and untiringly practised. Even then the seed of
anger will be there hidden in the bosom. You don’t know where it hides itself. By Japa, meditation
and ceaseless Sadhana with Isvarapranidhana or self-surrender to the Lord; by constant prayer ”O
Lord! I am nothing; Thy Will be done" and “Lord, grant me freedom from all vice,” you will be able
to invite His Grace. Then, when the all-pervading Self is realised and Jnana is obtained, then and
then alone will this greatest enemy of man, anger, be totally annihilated. Well, well; in any case this
Santananda had a little bit of success in his Sadhana. He had also given us valuable hints on how to
control anger. We are all benefited. He had failed only because while he had controlled anger to a
certain extent, he had allowed vanity to grow in him to the same extent. Anger only had taken the
form of vanity in him. Ego assumes various forms. All these forms are different in name only. He
who finds out the hiding places of this formidable ego and through ruthless enquiry into the nature
of the Ego and the nature of the Self, which is the Reality behind this false ego, he and he alone can
be said to have controlled anger. He will not only have annihilated anger, but he would have
destroyed all vices. He will be humble, simple, and divine, an embodiment of love and compassion.
Come, we shall continue our search for such a divine personality. His Darshan will purify us. His
service will elevate us to divine heights."

consciousness, the Atman that pervades all creation.

To realise this inner consciousness is the essence of Spiritual life.

Eliminate all that is negative and develop all that is sublime and good.

May the Lord bless you.

Thou Art That

Self-realisation is not a state of non-existence or mere blankness. It is here and now. It is
nothing to be attained afresh. You need not reach or attain the Atman or the Supreme Self. You are
indeed the Atman.

Self-realisation can be attained by men and women while living in the world and while

discharging their daily duties.

May the Lord bless you.

Aids To Self-Realisation

Brahman or the supreme Self is realisable by this method of direct vision or intuition though

not knowable by the ordinary rational methods.

Unselfishness, love of all beings, and love of God are the three aids to Self-realisation.

Without appropriate preparatory discipline, one cannot understand and discover the truths

of the Upanishads or Vedanta.

May the Lord bless you.

Faith Draws Grace

Neither art, nor science, nor erudition is necessary to approach God or realise Him. What is
wanted is a pure heart with love and devotion to God, a heart resolutely determined to apply itself to
Him alone, for His sake alone and to love Him alone.

The foundation of spiritual life is absolute faith in God. This will draw soon great grace

from God.

May the Lord bless you.
