His Holiness Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj did not write text books as such. The books he
wrote were the outpourings of wisdom from his own direct realisation of the Truth.
From his books you will derive not only the benefit of his wisdom and knowledge of both
practical and esoteric matters pertaining to Yoga, but also the power of his spiritual force.
Sri Swami Sivanandaji had a unique style—simple, direct and compelling. His books are not
dull treatises on Yoga and philosophy, rather his enthusiasm and eagerness to help all is evident in
every page, lifting the reader to new heights of understanding.
Sri Gurudev’s great utterances about the need for a Guru to lead the aspirant along the path to
God-realisation, and of the devotion that the aspirant should have towards his Guru, are scattered
over a number of his works. That great disciple of Sri Gurudev, Sri Swami Satchidanandaji (PrivateSecretary to H.H. Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj) felt the urge to compile Sri Swamiji’s “sayings”on Guru and Guru Bhakti Yoga into a single volume. Guru Bhakti Yoga is the result.
May Sri Gurudev’s Grace lead you to the Highest Realms of Immortality, Eternal Bliss and
Supreme Peace.

Dear Vivek,
Wisdom or Knowledge of the Self (Brahma-Jnana) never dawns upon the
mind which is filled with greed, anger, lust and jealousy, which is under the control of desires andexpectations and which is devoid of contentment.
Wisdom dawns only in a pure and calm mind.
Therefore purify your mind and develop serenity.

Just as Kirtan-Sadhana has been made the special Kali-Yuga Sadhana for quick God-vision,
even so herein you have the New Yoga, a Yoga most eminently suitable for this age of doubt and
scepticism, pride and egoism. It is Guru-Bhakti Yoga. This Yoga is marvellous. Its power is
tremendous. Its efficacy is most unfailing. The true glory of Guru-Bhakti is indescribable. It is the
Yoga par excellence for this age, which makes God appear here before you in flesh and blood andmove with you in this very life. The hard Rajasic ego is the arch enemy of the Sadhaka.Guru-Bhakti Yoga is the surest and best Sadhana to destroy arrogance and to dissolve the vicious
ego. Just as a particular deadly germ can be annihilated only by a certain specific chemical
germicide, even so, to destroy Avidya and Ahankara, this unique Guru Bhakti-Yoga is the peerlessspecific. They are the gravest ‘Mayacide’ and ‘egocide’. They become quite powerless and nolonger afflict the fortunate soul who saturates himself with the spirit of Guru-Bhakti-Yoga. Blessedindeed is the man who earnestly takes to this Yoga; for he will obtain crowning success in all otherYogas. To him will accrue the choicest fruits of perfection in Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana and Jnana.
The qualification for taking to this Yoga is the simple trio of sincerity, faith and obedience. Be
sincere in your aspirations for Perfection. Be not vague or half-hearted. Then have perfect faith in
the one you have accepted as your Guru. Do not allow even so much as a shadow of doubt toapproach you. When once you have reposed absolute faith in him, then know that what he instructsyou is indeed for your highest good. Therefore, obey his word implicitly. Follow his teachings tothe letter. Be earnest in doing thus, and take my word: you will attain Perfection; I assure youemphatically.

Maharani Swarnalata,
From a doctor you get a prescription. From two doctors you get consultation. From three
doctors you get your own cremation.
Even so, if you have many Gurus you will be bewildered. You will be at a loss to know what to
do. One Guru will tell you: “Do Soham Japa”. Another will tell you “Do Japa of Sri Ram.” A third
Guru will tell you “Hear Anahata Sounds”. You will be puzzled. Stick to one Guru and follow his
instructions.

Beloved Mahadev,
Realisation cannot come to you as a miracle done by your Guru.
Lord Buddha, Lord Jesus, Rama Tirtha have all done Sadhana. Lord Krishna asks Arjuna to
develop Vairagya and do Abhyasa. He did not say to him “I will give you Mukti now”.
Therefore abandon the wrong notion that your Guru will give you Samadhi and Mukti. Strive,
purify, meditate and realise.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge is subject-object relation. It is a process, and not being. All processes are
movements brought about by an interaction of external stimuli and internal condition. The rise of
knowledge in an individual is a mysterious process effected through such an interaction. No doubt,
knowledge in its essential nature is universal and does not admit of any process. But by the rise of
knowledge what is meant is not the existence of this transcendent awareness, but the process of themanifestation of it in the relative individual the highest knowledge is called Swaroopa-Jnana,knowledge of being as such. But the rise of knowledge in the Jiva is a relative act of the expression
of this Swaroopa-Jnana through the Vritti of the Manas. Hence during the process of the rise
knowledge takes the form of what is termed Vritti Jnana. Ana Vritti-Jnana is definitely aspatio-temporal condition of consciousness.
Vritti-Jnana is the same as psychological consciousness, whatever be the degree of its intensity,
depth and expansiveness. Vritti-Jnana therefore cannot appear without the relation of the subject toan object. This relation is the coming together of the subjective and the objective processes in theuniverse. Every event is a commingling of two events or conditions, one acting as the subject andthe other as the object. The spiritual aspirant may be considered from his point of view a subjective
entity in which spiritual knowledge manifests itself by degrees. Now this manifestation of

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book knowledge is really the reflection of the Transcendental Consciousness through the mind which
gradually increases its transparency by the process of self discipline and concentration. It is thedifference in the degree of transparency in the mind that is responsible for the difference that we
notice in the degree of intensity of the manifestation of knowledge. As every event, in order to take
place, requires an external agency, the aspirant is in need of a Guru to enable the manifestation ofthe knowledge within him. The disciple and the Guru are two complementary entities or bits ofuniversal process acting on each other in a reciprocal manner. The factors that bring about the rise
of knowledge in the disciple are the receptive capacity of the disciple and the consciousness-force
of the Guru. There cannot be such a knowledge-interaction if the psychic condition of the disciple isnot well-prepared and made ready to fit in with the nature of the entry of the consciousness of theGuru into it. This condition has to be fulfilled when any event in this universe takes place. Nointeraction of any kind can take place anywhere unless two complementary phases of universalprocess came together.
That knowledge can rise of its own accord from within by self-analysis and that an external
Guru is not necessary at all is not a universally acceptable tenet. History has shown that the
educational process is in great need of the intense activity of teachers in any branch of learning. Ifknowledge can naturally rise in everyone without any aid whatsoever there would be no need forschools, colleges and universities in the world. Even those who try to propound this misleadingtheory of the self-competency of the individual who can act independent of teachers are personswho have been trained by teachers. Yes; the effort on the part of the disciple or student is not, in anyway, a small factor in the revelation of knowledge; it is as important as the need for instruction by ateacher. In this universe the subject and the object stand on the same level of reality, which fact isproved by the possibility of a mutual interaction of the two. There is no reaction between forces ofdifferent planes of consciousness, though in the case of the action of the Guru it is possible that hemay focus his higher consciousness through the medium of a lesser plane in which the disciple isplaced, in order to bring about the required transformation in the mind of the latter. This process ofthe action of the Guru’s consciousness is called Shakti-Sanchara or the descent of movement of thepower of the Guru in the disciple. There are cases where Gurus have even done Sadhana for theevolution of the disciples by bringing about the purification of the mind of the disciples throughdirect intervention of a higher consciousness.
There are people who carp and say: “We can find out good and evil, right and wrong, truth and
falsehood, by consulting our conscience. There is no need for an external Guru.” It should beremembered that the conscience will not help a person in attaining to correct understanding unlesshe has reached the height of purity and desirelessness. The impure conscience cannot give rightsuggestion. The animal conscience cannot direct a person to spiritual knowledge. One’s reason andintellectual convictions are tremendously influenced by one’s subconscious and unconscious mind.The intellect, in most cases, acts as a mere tool in the hands of buried instincts and desires. Theconscience of the individual speaks in accordance with his tendencies, proclivities, inclinations,education, habits, passions and the society in which he is placed. The conscience of a savage speaksa language entirely different from that of a civilised European. The Conscience of an African Negrospeaks in a manner quite different from the one in which the conscience of an ethically developedYogi of India does. The sense of duty ingrained in a clerk, a car-driver, a scavenger, a collector anda king is not the same. There are ten different consciences in ten different persons brought up in tendifferent conditions. Virochana thought for himself, took guidance from his conscience, enquiredfor himself and came to the conclusion that body is the ultimate self. It should be remembered that

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book the human consciousness is entangled in animal instincts, emotions and gross desires. The tendency
of the mind of man is to move in this direction of sense and ego, and not towards higher knowledge.A complete surrender of personality to the Guru who is endowed with the highest realisation avoids
such pitfalls on the path of Sadhana and takes the aspirant safely to the light that shines beyond the
darkness of Samsara. Human reason and human conscience act in the manner in which they aretrained, and as ordinarily they are accustomed to function in accordance with the laws of theappearance of the world and the objects of sense and of the cravings and the ambitions of the ego,
they cannot be expected to take one spontaneously to the higher realms of spiritual knowledge.
Those who teach the theory that a Guru is not necessary and that each one should follow one’s
own reason and conscience forget the ostensible fact that they themselves take on themselves the
role of the Gurus to those whom they teach the doctrine. They begin to command respect, adorationand worship as great teachers, though they teach that there is no need for a teacher. We know howthe Buddha, for example, asked his disciples to think for themselves rationally and convincethemselves for themselves in regard to the validity of the doctrine which he preached and not toaccept anything by mere authority of his word. He did not propound the worship of any god, too.
However, the result has been that he is being worshipped as a Great Guru and even a God. Theteaching in regard to thinking for oneself and the denial of the need for a Guru naturally implies theacceptance, on the part of the taught, of the person who teaches as a Guru. It is found that the needfor a Guru cannot be overcome in any walk of life. It is the nature of human experience to geteffected by a process of subject-object interaction.
There is a feeling among some people in the West that the ‘dependence’ of the disciple on the
Guru is a psychological bondage which according to the theory of psycho-analysis has to be gotover. In this connection it has to be noted however that the relation of the disciple to the Guru is notthe psychological dependence which psycho-analysis is familiar with but the surrender ofpersonality to the care of a higher consciousness which includes and transcends the limitedindividualistic consciousness of the disciple. Further, the disciple’s dependence on the Guru takesthe form of a personal relationship only in the beginning, but in the end it becomes a veritablesurrender of the individual to the universal. The Guru becomes a symbol of the Eternal. Thepatient’s dependence on the psycho analyst will not doubt a relationship from which the patient hasto break himself away, for this dependence is brought about temporarily for the sake of bringingabout a relief of tension in the mind of the patient. When the task is done, the dependence is brokenand overcome and the patient becomes free and independent as before. But neither in the beginningnor in the end the relationship of the disciple to the Guru takes the shape of an undesirabledependence. It is dependence on the universal through and through. The Guru is taken not as a bodyor even as a personality but as a representation of the highest spiritual reality. Thus the dependenceof the disciple on the Guru is a gradual process of self-purification on the part of the disciple and ofhis final attainment of the supreme Godhead.
There are some who often cite the instance of Yajnavalkya’s dissociation of himself from his
Guru Vaishampayana as an indication even in ancient times of the possibility of one’s leading anindependent spiritual life unrelated to any Guru other than oneself. It is true that Yajnavalkyadisconnected himself from Vaishampayana, but this was not because he was not loyal to his Gurubut because the Guru was enraged at him and asked him to quit his Ashrama after returning to himwhatever knowledge he had imparted. This, of course, created in Yajnavalkya a distrust towards allhuman Gurus, but he did not give up his search for a Guru. Instead of feeling that there is no need for

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book having a Guru and that one can proceed for oneself independently along the spiritual path, he
resorted to a superior Guru, the Sun-God Himself. There is no argument whatsoever in thebehaviour of Yajnavalkya which can establish or demonstrate the undesirability of dedicating
oneself to a Guru. And when Yajnavalkya acquired a fresh knowledge from the Sun-God, he was
ready to impart it to the other disciples of his previous Guru at the request of the latter who is said tohave been highly pleased later on at the tremendous strength and aspiration and courage whichYajnavalkya revealed in propitiating the Sun-God.
The highest Guru is God Himself Who reveals Himself in manifold forms through Nature. The
universe in which we live is a great teacher of the lessons of life. Every event that occurs before oureyes presents itself before us as a deep lesson with deep significance in it, if only we would be aliveto the manner in which Nature works. The universe is the body of God, and it operates in a verymysterious way embracing within its processes the whole gamut of experience, internal as well asexternal, subjective as well as objective. All that we sense, feel or understand is meant to bringabout in us the necessary transformation required in our evolution towards the Supreme Being.
When the process of universal evolution is cut off from our individual consciousness, it goes by
the name of mechanistic evolution which seems to drag all individuals with it by force and over
which no individual seems to have any control. But when this evolution becomes a part and parcelof one’s consciousness and is assimilated into one’s consciousness it is called the process of Yoga.Yoga is really the cosmic evolution envisaged by the human consciousness in its own Self and withwhich it has identified its own being. It may also be said to be a compression as it were of the wholescheme of a cosmic process in the human consciousness. When this is done, the surrender of theindividual to the Will of God or the Law of the Supreme becomes so complete that all apparentconflict that is seen to exist between the operations of Nature and the ambitions of man vanishesaltogether, and human aspiration becomes inseparable from Divine Will and the processes of theuniverse. This is the highest concept of the Guru, to which every aspirant has to rise, ultimately. Theacceptance of a personal Guru is a preparation for and is one of the steps leading to the finalabsorption of the individual in the Universal. There are various stages in the development of the
concept of the Guru and in the manner in which one surrenders oneself to the Guru. But in no stage
of spiritual Sadhana can the need for the Guru be overlooked, for the Guru is a name applied to thedifferent degrees in which the Absolute manifests Itself in relation to the aspirant endeavouring torealise it in his Self.

GURU-BHAKTI YOGA
The Limbs of Guru-Bhakti Yoga
l. Now then an exposition of Guru-Bhakti Yoga.
2. Guru-Bhakti Yoga is total self-surrender to Satguru.3. The important eight limbs of the Guru-Bhakti Yoga are, (a) the real lasting aspiration to
practise Guru-Bhakti Yoga; (b) absolute faith in the thoughts, words and actions of Satguru; (c)
doing Sashtanga Namaskara with humility and repeating Guru’s name; (d) perfect obedience incarrying out Guru’s commands; (e) doing personal service to Satguru without expectation of fruits;
(f) daily worshipping of the Lotus-Feet of Satguru with Bhav and devotion; (g) self-surrender or

17. In Yoga Vasishtha Sri Vasishtha says, “O Rama! give one fourth of mind for meditation in
the beginning, one fourth for recreation, one-fourth for study, and one fourth for the service of
Guru.”
18. Nobody can give Moksha. You will have to tread the spiritual path step by step. Books and
Guru can show you the path and guide you.
19. Lord has given you all sorts of comforts, good health, and a Guru to guide you. What more
do you want? Grow. Evolve. Realise the Truth and proclaim it everywhere.
20. Guru and Sastras can show you the path and remove your doubts. Anubhava of Aparoksha
kind (direct, intuitive knowledge) is left for your own experience. A hungry man will have to eat forhimself. He who has a severe itching will have to scratch for himself.
Methods of Mind-Control
21. Never wrestle with the mind. Don’t use any violent efforts in concentration. Relax all the
muscles and the nerves. Relax the brain. Gently think of your Ishtam. Slowly repeat your Guru
Mantra with Bhav and meaning. Still the bubbling mind. Silence the thoughts.
22. If the mind is divested of all the Sankalpas of ‘I’, then through meditation of Atman after
being initiated by a Guru, and having known the real significance of the Vedas, the mind can be
turned back from various pains and made to rest on the subjective blissful Atman.
23. Don’t shake the body. Keep it as firm as a rock. Breathe slowly. Don’t scratch the body
every now and then. Have the right mental attitude as taught by your Guru.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book 24. Be under the direct guidance and in close contact with your Guru for some years. You will
have steady and continuous progress.
25. A wavering mind jumps from one Sadhana to another Sadhana, from one Guru to another
Guru, from Bhakti Yoga to Vedanta, from Rishikesh to Brindavan. This is extremely deleterious for
Sadhana. Stick to one Guru and one place.
26. You will have to find out yourself the kind of meditation that is suitable for you. If you are
not able to do this, you will have to consult a teacher or preceptor who has attained Self-realisation.He will be able to know the nature of your mind and the correct method of meditation for you.
27. Company of spiritual teacher and good environments play a tremendous part in the
elevation of the mind. In the absence of positive good company, have negative good company ofbooks written by realised persons e.g. Sri Sankaracharya’s works, Yoga Vasishtha and SriDattatreya’s Avadhuta Gita etc.
28. Saguna meditation is meditation on a form. Select any Murthy you like best, either Siva,
Vishnu, Rama, or Krishna according to your inclination or taste or follow the directions of your
Guru. He will select for you the Ishta Devata or tutelary deity.
Progress on the Path
29. Lay bare to your Guru the secrets of your heart. The more you do so, the greater the
sympathy, which means an accession of strength to you in the struggle against sin and temptation.
30. Be careful in the selection of your companions. Undesirable persons easily shake your faith
and belief. Have full faith in your spiritual teacher and the Sadhana which you are pursuing. Never
allow your own convictions to be changed. Continue your Sadhana with zeal and enthusiasm. Youwill have quick spiritual progress and you will ascend the spiritual ladder step by step and reach thegoal ultimately.
31. Like birds, fish and tortoise, the transmitting of spiritual powers can be done by the Guru,
through touch, or sight, or willing and thinking. The Guru sometimes enters the astral body of thedisciple and elevates his mind through his power.
32. Sometimes a religious teacher has to express a little anger outwardly to correct his disciple.
This is not bad.
33. Some do meditation for some years independently. Later on they actually feel the necessity
of a Guru. They come across some obstacles in the way. They do not know how to obviate these
impediments or stumbling blocks. Then they begin to search for a master. A stranger in a big cityfinds it difficult to go back to his residence in a small avenue even in broad daylight, even though hehas walked half a dozen times. When difficulty arises even in the case of finding out the way instreets and roads, what to speak of the difficulties in the razor-path of spirituality when one walksalone with closed eyes!
The Transformation
34. The lower nature of mind must be thoroughly regenerated. The aspirant says to his
preceptor, “I want to practise Yoga. I want to enter into Nirvikalpa Samadhi. I want to sit at your

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book feet. I have surrendered myself to you.” But he does not want to change his lower nature and habits,
old character, behaviour and conduct.
35. This change of the lower nature is not easy. The force of habit is ever strong and inveterate.
It demands great strength of will. The aspirant often feels helpless against the force of old habits. He
will have to develop his Sattva and will to a considerable degree by regular Japa, Kirtan,meditation, untiring selfless service, Satsanga. He must introspect and find out his own defects andweaknesses. He must live under the guidance of his Guru. The Guru finds out his defects and points
out suitable ways to eradicate them.
36. You must equip yourself with the four means of salvation and then approach a
Brahma-Srotri, Brahmanishtha Guru. You must clear your doubts. You should tread the spiritual
path through the aid of the spiritual illumination imparted by your Guru. You should live with himtill you are moulded properly. Personal contact with a realised soul is highly elevating. If you aresincere and earnest, if you have burning desire for liberation, if you strictly follow the instructionsof your preceptor, if you do constant and intense meditation, then there is no doubt that the highest
goal can be reached within six months. Take my word for it. It will really happen.
37. The world is full of temptations. Therefore neophytes should guard themselves very
carefully. They should sit at the Lotus-Feet of their Gurus till they are completely moulded, till theyget established in deep meditation. Happy-go-lucky aspirants who are independent from thebeginning, who do not pay attention to the words of their preceptors are hopeless specimens. Theylead an aimless life and are drifted here and there like the plank in a river.
38. The aspirant who is endowed with the four means of Salvation, hears the Srutis and the
significance of “Tat Tvam Asi” Mahavakya at the feet of Guru, and then reflects deeply on what hehas heard.
39. Fix the mind on the form of Lord Hari or Lord Siva or Lord Krishna or your Guru or any
saint like Lord Buddha or Lord Jesus. Again and again try to call this mental image of the picture.
All thoughts will die. This is another method, the method of Bhaktas. The merciful loving Guru
always addresses his disciples “Hey Saumya.”
Spiritual Attitude to Guru
40. O revered teacher! The Dispeller of my Avidya, my adorations unto Thee! Through Thy
grace, I am enjoying the eternal bliss of Brahman. I am absolutely fearless. Now all my doubts and
delusions have vanished.
41. The disciple relates his own inner experiences to his Guru in this Mantra. The disciple
prostrated at the Lotus-Feet of his Guru, showered on him the choicest flowers and eulogised him,
“O venerable, holy master! I have realised myself. I have attained supreme bliss through Thy grace.I have liberated myself from the wheel of births and deaths through the Brahmanishtha. I am
enjoying the unalloyed bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. I shall roam freely in any part of the world. I
have equal vision over all. I have abandoned the lower mind. I have destroyed all Sankalpas, likesand dislikes. I enjoy now unruffled peace I am not able to describe my exalted state. O worshipfulAcharya! I am dumbfounded. Again and again I prostrate before thee. You have helped me incrossing this formidable ocean of Samsara.

do not know what virtuous actions led me to the attainment of the Supreme fearless state. This is a
rare fortune indeed. This is a great Adrishta. I dance now in joy. I have obtained now
Duhkha-abhava, Sarva Kamapti, Krita Krityatva and Prapta Prapyatva (all pains have vanished; all
my desires are gratified; I have fulfilled all actions; I have obtained all objects of desire).
43. “Thou art my real father and mother. How can I describe my present state to another man? I
see everywhere endless ocean of bliss and knowledge. Thanks to the Mahavakya “Tat Tvam Asi”
which opened my real eye of intuition. Thanks to the Upanishads, Vedanta Sutras and Vedantic
Sastras. Prostrations unto Sri Vyasa, Sri Sankara and the Brahma-Vidya Gurus and the Seers andRishis of the Upanishads and Lord Siva and Lord Narayana who have assumed the form ofBrahmanishtha Guru and the forms of the Mahavakyas of the Upanishads. Even if a drop of theCharanamrita of the Guru is sprinkled over the head of a worldly man all his miseries will come toan end. If one Brahmanishtha is clothed and fed, the whole world is clothed and fed, because “He isthe All”. He is the All in all. Om Om Om.
44. O merciful Master! I bow to Thee. I have fallen into the dreadful ocean of births and deaths.
I am afflicted with the three kinds of Taapas. Save me. O Lord! Teach me, how I should cross this
ocean of Samsara.
45. Fear not! My child! In reality there is no death for thee. There is a means for crossing this
ocean of relative existence and attaining immortality or the Supreme Bliss. I shall teach thee nowBrahma-Vidya. Hear with rapt attention.
46. Salutations unto Thee, O Venerable Guru! Thou hast saved me from the wheel of births and
deaths. Through Thy grace I have attained Immortality and Eternal Bliss. All my doubts, delusionand ignorance have vanished. Crores of prostrations unto Thee, O merciful Lord.
The Obstinate Disciple
47. The obstinate disciple clings to his old habits. He will not surrender to the Lord or personal
Guru.
48. If the disciple really desires to improve himself, he must be frank with himself and
straightforward to his Guru.
49. He who is disobedient, who breaks the discipline, who is not straightforward to his Guru,
who cannot open his heart to his preceptor or spiritual guide, cannot be benefited by the help of
Guru. He remains stuck in his own self-created mire or mud and cannot progress in the divine path.
What a great pity! His lot is highly lamentable indeed.
50. The disciple must make total, unreserved, ungrudging self-surrender to the Lord or Guru.
51. All that the teacher can do is to tell his disciple the method of knowing the Truth or the Path,
that leads to the unfoldment of intuitional faculty.
The Need for Guru
52. A Guru is necessary for every aspirant in the spiritual path.

devotion for him.

Benefits of Discipleship

66. Sometimes the methods prescribed by the Guru may not be to the disciple’s immediate
liking, but he must have the firm faith that it is for his own benefit and good.

imagining that they have attained Chitta-Suddhi. They do not gain the Supreme Knowledge; they
do not reach their Goal.

great loss, a great blunder.
Guru-Bhakti and Guru-Seva
76. Guru-Bhakti and Guru-Seva are like the two oars of the boat of Sadhana that takes the
disciple across the torrential stream of Samsara.
77. One who has surrendered himself to his Guru, one who serves the Guru whole-heartedly,
one who has marvellous Guru-Bhakti, knows no grief, no sorrow, no fear, no pain no misery, no
ignorance and he instantly attains God-realisation.
78. Guru and God are one. So adore him.
79. One of the greatest souls that ever blessed this universe with his presence is the radiant
Sankaracharya who is Adi Guru and Jagadguru.
80. If the disciple gets the shelter of the Lotus-Feet of a Guru, one who has known what has to
be known, one who has attained what has to be attained and who is in a position to show the way, he

with perseverance and determination, he will realise God.
86. Of all the virtues which a disciple must have the greatest virtue is obedience to his Guru.
Value of Obedience
87. Obedience is precious virtue, because if you try to develop the virtue of obedience, the ego,
the arch-enemy on the path of Self-realisation, slowly gets rooted out.
88. To have complete obedience to Guru is a difficult task, but by trying with sincerity it
becomes easy.
89. Even ordinary action requires great pain, so in the spiritual path, one must be prepared to
subject oneself to some sort of discipline and try to cultivate obedience to the Teacher.
90. Far more than worship, garlanding, and other outward manifestations of one’s inner Bhava
of adorations and worshipfulness, obedience to Guru is greater.
91. Obedience to Guru shows true reverence unto him.92. Obedience means trying to act in the way in which the Guru would like one to act.

Offerings to the Guru

Sadhana-Chatushtaya. Otherwise the initiation will not be of much use.
100. In ancient days disciple should approach preceptor with the Samit in his hands. Samit is
the symbol of self-dedication and surrender to the Lotus-Feet of Guru.
101. “Here is the bundle of my Karmas. You burn it.” This is implied in the Sishya’s
approaching the Guru with Samits in hands. The outward meaning is that Rishis used to performAgnihotra and this symbolises service of the Guru in the form bringing fire-wood for sacrifice.
102. Spiritual Realisation is the result of supreme devotion to Guru.
103. You will find in the Manu Smriti: “Let the students ever engage in the study of Vedas and
during services to the preceptor with full faith and devotion. Let the student refrain from wines,
meats, perfumes, scents, women, tasty dishes, and from injury to sentient creatures and lust, anger,greed, dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments, dyes, playing, gossiping, slander, too
much sleeping and untruth.”

43. Contact with the objects should be avoided till attachment, which taints the mind, is
completely cut off by the powerful weapon of intense devotion to Guru.
44. He who practises Yoga, by taking refuge in Guru, is not overcome by various obstacles.
45. The true disciple should, unhesitatingly and without shyness, prostrate on the ground
‘Sashtanga’ as a token of his complete surrender, at the Holy Feet of his Guru.

reward will never go wrong, nor will he ever lose the benefit of such worship and service.

for anything of this world, which, is transitory.
93. It is to the disciple who has got a Guru that the doors of Immortality are opened.

CARDINAL NOTES ON GURU-BHAKTI
The Content of Spiritual Teaching
1. Service of the Guru who is a liberated one, the study of the books which are written by him,
and meditation on his holy form is the golden medium to develop Guru-Bhakti.
2. The disciple who runs after name, fame, power wealth and sex cannot cultivate true devotion
to the Lotus-Feet of Satguru.
3. The field of education is very, very wide and scope of acquiring knowledge is infinite, that
the need for a Guru is inevitable.
4. The Taittireeya Upanishad says, “Now about the knowledge. The preceptor is the first form.
The disciple is the last form. Knowledge is the link between the two, and instruction is the medium,
effecting such a union or link. This is the field of knowledge.”
5. Kathopanishad says, “that Self which is being taught over in various ways, is not easily
known when taught by a man of inferior intellect, but when taught by one who is established inBrahman, there is no doubt at all. The Self, being subtler than the subtle, is not to be obtained by
mere intellectual gymnastics. Guru-Kripa alone can bestow knowledge.
Guru-Disciple Relationship
6. Disciple should remain in the house of preceptor, maintaining full Brahmacharya for twelve
years and do rigorous Tapas. And he should also serve him and study the sacred scriptures under
him.
7. He alone can be a Guru who is fit to teach the disciple, who can himself practise whatever he
teaches.
8. One ought not accept anyone and everyone as his Guru. Once after accepting him as a Guru
one should not divorce him on any account.
9. Teachers of real spiritual enlightenment are very rare in these days.
10. Really advanced spiritual persons will not undertake the duty of being a Guru unless they
have got Command from the Almighty.
11. When a deserving aspirant goes in quest of Guru to initiate him to the spiritual path, God
appears before him as a Guru and initiates him.
12. Guru, who is a liberated one, lives in a different plane of consciousness which is termed as
Tureeya Avastha. The disciple who wants to become one with Guru must equip himself with the
virtue of absolute detachment from the worldly transitory things.

him and you will feel equality with him.

82. It is a great blunder on the part of seeker after the truth to say “Na Guru na sishya” after
studying some Vedantic Texts independently.
83. Some time Guru suffers physically on account of taking disciple’s sins. In fact Guru never
suffers from any physical diseases or ailments; but it is only a rare chance given to the disciple to
purify his heart by serving him with great (devotion) and earnestness.

and balanced mind. He is equal in honour and dishonour, censure and praise, pleasure and pain. He

GURU PURNIMA MESSAGES
1956
Know Thy Self And Be Free!
“People seldom improve when they have no model but themselves to copy,” said Oliver
Goldsmith. “He that hath ears, let him hear; he that hath eyes, let him see,” said Jesus Christ.
Through ages gone by, the torch of truth, of supernal beauty and immortality, of the enduring
values of life, of the secrets of spiritual illumination, has been passed on through a succession of
great and glorious souls, the teachers of humanity, the custodians of all that is worth living for.
In the vast, sprawling school of life, studded with myriads of beckoning entities and
experiences, Nature Herself, the stupendous Teacher par excellence , holds out the means to the
solution of all vexing problems, mysteries and anomalies.
“He that hath eyes, let him see.” The message is there always, the listeners, too, are there. But
those who deliberately shut their eyes and ears, would slumber on in their self-wrought gloom ofnescience; for no awakening can be truly effective unless there is a reciprocal willingness to wakeup.
Sincerity and earnestness, faith and willingness to learn, are therefore the first essential
requisite that every seeker must possess. Then he must have the gift of rational discrimination to sift
out the genuine from the false, the desirable from the undesirable, the conducive from theincompatible, and thereafter, a firm determination to hold on to what he has chosen with unreservedfaith and consistency, and pursue his ideal with relentless perseverance.
The relationship between the Guru and the disciple can hardly be enduring when pivoted on a
relative understanding, on a mundane sense of reciprocation. How best could one serve one’spreceptor? In the very best way that pleases him most, through implicit obedience spurred by aclear-cut and unbiased understanding. The most fruitful service that one can render to the preceptoris to be a pellucid example of his precept.
Seekers of Truth! On the holy occasion of the Guru Purnima, dedicate yourselves afresh to the
service of the teachers of humanity, to the ideals lived by them, to the teachings bestowed by them.Hearken their message of peace and goodwill, of unselfish love towards all beings, of willing
service to the suffering and the forlorn, of purification and refinement of your nature, of cultivation
of all that are positive and desirable, and effacement of all that are crude, coarse, mean and impure.
Forget not the goal. Forget not that truth is real untruth a dereliction; success is real, failure an
impetus; virtue is real, vice its enunciation; love is real, hate a misguided impulse; happiness is real,sorrow a self-delusion life is real, death a changing phase of life itself, always directed towards thebetter.
Meditate, and usher in the dawn of peace and inner illumination. Introspect, and cleanse the
dross of mundane desires. Reflect, and sift the real from the unreal. Amidst this earthly panorama of

The Wheel Of Divine Life
Salutations to the Supreme Guru, the Immortal Spirit, the common unifying entity present in
all. Salutations to the torch-bearers of knowledge divine. Salutations, to all seekers of truth who live
the life divine Adorations for all holy aspirations. Benedictions for the fruition of every noble
endeavour.
The eternal mysteries of the human spirit, the ever-restless and dissatisfied emotional being of
man, the inadequacies of the temporal existence, the failure of the intellect to solve the problems of
life satisfactorily. The baffling gulf that separates great ideals from rude realities—all tend to turn
one’s mind towards God. Divine life is the process through which one progresses towards the
realisation of God, and achieves the remedy of all the ills that life is heir to.
Guru is the guide who leads the aspirant on the way, and the aspirant is the pilgrim who toils on
the ascent of divine life.
A progressive refinement of the mental and moral make up of man is the primary objective of
divine life. It begins with dedication to some fundamental principles such as truth, purity, and
non-injury, the practice of which automatically entails the voluntary enforcement of self-discipline,and ensuing of the process of purification.
The implementation of these three fundamental principles in the daily life of the individual, in
an impeccable manner, itself constitutes the vital part of divine life.
Human nature has two sides, the negative and the positive, one trying to preponderate over the
other. There are invariably the “Dr. Jekyll” and “Mr. Hyde” elements in every man. When the“Hyde” element dominates, one becomes a social derelict, bringing upon oneself and others all theevil consequences of the boundless passions and destructive sadism of the instinctive part of one’sbeing. Yet, there are people who have in them a remarkable measure of the “Jekyll” element, whichdistinguishes them as great benefactors of society, and who are by far in a better position to be inpeace with themselves and with others, too.
The positive, ultimately overcomes the negative, though, in common experience, the negative
forces hold an irrepressible sway over frequent phases in the lives of the most of the people. But, notso with those who have made a beginning in walking the way of reason, of discretion, prudence,divine life. In them the discriminative mind tries to rule over the instinctive part of their being.Viveka guides their actions, Vairagya sanctifies their motives, and Mumukshutva inspires theirendeavours—each of the three deriving its strength and light from the spiritual part of their being.
To follow the path of truth, purity and non-injury is implicative of the highest form of
self-discipline, amounting to neutralising every negative propensity emanating from the lower

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book nature. Truth necessarily indicates, apart from the chastity of speech, the right sense of values, the
courage to implement into action what one knows to be true, though it may not be entirelyconducive, or may be even detrimental, to one’s material good. Truth also means the strength of
will to abide by all positive principles, a sense of justice an unbiased mind, and recognition of the
pervasiveness of its subtle essence in all life.
Purity is the touchstone of divine life which should have the power of transmuting all that is
negative into the positive. The practice of purity covers the entire range of the culturing of
emotions, and whatever is implied by self-restraint. It means the practice of the “Shat-sampat”
namely, control of mind, and the senses, tranquillity, forbearance, faith and concentration. Purity isphysical and mental, since both are interrelated. Purity of thought naturally leads to purity of actionas well as the sublimation of the sex-urge. Purity of motive, of life in general, is preliminary to thepractice of truth.
Non-injury is love, indicated counterwise. Here self-restraint (Yama) is again incumbent. The
meaning of non-injury is complete only when it is implemented whole-heartedly—in thought,
speech and action. The principles of love compassion, mercy, fellowship and goodwill are allentwined in the term “non-injury.” Unless these principles are fully practised, the virtue ofnon-injury remains artificial.
Whilst love is a direct expression of non-injury, its logical fruition is in service. That
much-maligned term “love”, which is overly misapplied to sensual tomfoolery, selfish attachment,circumstantial sentimentality, emotional fixation, and superimposed self-pity, is, indeed, a rareplant that grows only in the garden of divine life and that has to be continuously tended and nurturedto make it enblossom in all its glory. Love and service are inseparable. So, too, with understandingof, and respect for, the feelings of others. One cannot be said to possess love for humanity, and yetbe selfish and callous to the suffering of others. The selfless service is divine love in action.
If you are able to cultivate and practise these three basic tenets of divine life, which, in reality,
traverse the entire gamut of practical spirituality, then you are on the road to Self-realisation, the
ultimate goal of human aspiration. Even a rudimentary success in this path is greatly conducive to
one’s peace and happiness, to the worthiness of existence, to the betterment of human nature, to thegood of society and the world at large. A collective awareness of the great importance of divine life,with all its pragmatic values, can surely contribute, in a large measure, to the promotion ofworld-peace, solidarity and fellowship.
Brahmavidya is, in other words, the knowledge of divine life, the central ideal of all spiritual
aspirants. In this alone lies the salvation of mankind. May the blessings of the Divine Guru be uponall.

Yoga should be learnt from a Guru. And this is true all the more in the case of Tantra Yoga. It is
the Guru who will recognise the class to which the aspirant belongs and prescribe suitable Sadhana.
Nowadays aspirants have the dangerous and wrong notion of imagining that they are highly
qualified to adopt the highest form of Yoga in the very beginning of their Sadhana. This is the
reason for the early downfall of the majority of aspirants. This itself shows that he is not yet ready totake to Yoga. The real, qualified aspirant will be humble enough to approach a Guru, surrenderhimself to the Guru, serve the Guru and learn Yoga from the Guru.
The Guru is none other than the Supreme Divine Mother Herself, descended into the world in
order to elevate the aspirant. Deify the Guru. Then only you will be really benefited. Serve himuntiringly. He will, of his own accord, bestow the supreme blessing of Diksha upon you.
Diksha is the giving of the Mantra by the Guru. Initiation gives spiritual knowledge and
destroys sin. As one lamp is lit at the flame of another, so the divine Sakti consisting of Mantra iscommunicated from Guru to the disciple. The disciple fasts, observes Brahmacharya and gets theMantra from the Guru.
Initiation tears the veil of mystery and enables the disciple to grasp the hidden truth behind
scriptural truths. These are generally veiled in mystic language. You cannot understand them by
self-study. Self-study will only lead you to greater ignorance. The Guru only will give you, byDiksha, the right perspective in which to study the scriptures. He will flash his torch ofSelf-realisation on the truth which you will grasp immediately.
LIMBS OF GURU-BHAKTI
Guru-Bhakti is service of the Guru or love for the Guru. It is of four kinds: Aaptam, Angam,
Daanam, Sadbhaavam.
Aaptam means strong faith in the words of Guru and loving obedience of his commands.
Angam means pleasing, personal services, for e.g. protection of the body of the Guru, washing
his clothes, bathing the Guru, etc.
Daanam means surrender (dedication) of all possessions, such as, house and other property,
wealth, etc., and taking shelter at him.
Sadbhaava means taking the Guru as God and never as man.
If one serves the Guru with the Bhava that Guru is God, then that disciple is blessed with
Drishtam and Adrishtam.
Drishtam means the Jnana, Bliss which a disciple gets by the Upadesha of the Mahavakya by
Guru’s Grace.
Adrishtam means the Bliss enjoyed after death in other world.Thus it is clear that by service of Guru with proper Bhava, one gets two fruits (Drishtam and
Adrishtam); whereas by service of God one gets Adrishtam alone.

The Frog And Faithless Disciple
A frog lives near the lotus;
But it does not drink the honey of the lotus,A bee from a distant place comes
And drinks the honey of the Padma

And remain near him like the frog.
Some people who live in distant placesWho have intense faith in their Guru,Who strictly follow life-instructions,Obtain the grace of the Guru,And attain the goal of life quickly.

To learn you need a teacher,
To learn science you need a professor,To learn any art you need a master.

To take you across the Samsaric deluge,On the thorny path of Truth;To guide you, there is none but Guru.
Guru’ s grace can work wonders,
Look up to him for light and joy;

Guru is the torch-bearer of wisdom
Guru, Isvara, Brahman are one;
Salute him first before you salute Hari,Because it is he who takes you to Hari.
Take the Mantra from your Guru,
He will inspire you at every stage;He will not do the Sadhana for you,You will have to do it yourself.
Guru will show you the right path,
He will select for you the right Yoga,
He will remove doubts and obstacles,He will lift you up from pitfalls and snares.
To him offer your heart and soul,
Sacrifice your body and life itself:He will take care of your soul;You can transcend Maya to rest in peace.
Do not expect a miracle from your Guru
To lift you up into Samadhi;Do rigorous Sadhana yourself;A hungry man will have to eat himself.
If you cannot get a Satguru,
You can approach a senior,You can take him as your Guru,He will also guide you.
Be patient and select your Guru,
You cannot divorce your Guru;Relation between Guru and ChelaIs sacred and life-long.
He who has knowledge of the Self,
He who has knowledge of the Shastras,He who is endowed with noble virtues,Is a Satguru.
To test a Guru is difficult,
A Jesus only can know another Jesus,A Shakespeare only can know another Shakespeare.How can a patient test the doctor?

Superimpose on him the attributes of the Lord,Then only you will be benefited.
If you are elevated in one’s presence,
If you are inspired by his speeches,If he is able to clear your doubts,If he is free from greed, anger, and lust,If he is selfless, loving and I-less,You can take him as your Guru.
To approach a Guru,
You must be a proper Adhikari,You should possess Vairagya,Serenity, self-restraint and Yama.
If you say, ‘There is no good Guru’
Guru also says, ‘There is no good disciple.’Do not blame others,Blame yourself first.
Guru is your redeemer
But Gurudom is a curse,Guru is your saviourBut Gurudom is a canker.
If Guru says,
‘I will show you KrishnaWithin fifteen days’He is a false Guru.Don’t believe him,Beware of pseudo-Gurus.

The transformation of consciousness of the disciple through being influenced by the Guru is
both a subjective and an objective process. Mind is an objectified stress in universal consciousness
and is like a ripple therein. The Guru as well as the disciple are such consciousness-stresses
differing only in the degree of the subtlety and the expansiveness of their condition. Each higher,
subtler and more expansive condition is more potent and inclusive than the lower. The Guru is aBrahmanishtha one rooted in the Infinite Truth. The mind of the Guru, being nearest to the absolute
condition of changeless Existence, possesses limitless powers beyond imagination. The initiation
of the disciple by the Guru is a process of the infusion by the Guru of this supernormal force of
spiritual consciousness into the grosser state of the disciple’s mind which results in the dispelling ofthe darkness and the enlightening of the mind of the latter. The length of time taken by the processof the disciple’s spiritual illumination is directly proportional to the receptive capacity of thedisciple and the Consciousness-Force of the Guru. No action or event is completely subjective orcompletely objective.
The truth is midway between the two. Effort and grace are the subjective and the objective
forces simultaneously working and each depending on the other. The external and the internal are
the two complementary faces of the one whole being. There is no purpose served when there is onlythe eye or when there is only the external luminous object. The contact of both effects theperception of the light. If entire subjectivity were the truth, the whole world would have vanishedwhen the first person attained Self-realisation. If entire objectivity were the truth, no person couldhave attained Liberation, until the entire universe was exalted to the consciousness of theunconditioned absolute. But none of these is the complete truth. The subject and the object haveequal shares in the transformation of an individual. The one is a copy of the other. The world is thematerialisation of the collective totality of the thoughts of all the beings constituting it, and, hence,the dissolution of the mind of one being among them requires a reshuffling in the thoughts of theothers; for the sustenance of the world thenceforth is the work of only the remaining ones. Thus theoccurring of an event is through blending together of both the internal and the external, thesubjective and the objective powers of the Pure Being. The Guru’s unlimited consciousnessinvades the dark corner of the disciple who is able to bear it through the strength of truth and purityand who receives it to the extent his mind is purged of Rajas and Tamas. The Guru is identical withthe Existence Itself and, hence, the help which is derived from him cannot be estimated by thefaculty of thinking.
It is a decided and established conclusion that Guru is absolutely essential for spiritual
progress. Even secular science, arts and all worldly undertakings need the help of a teacher. Moreso, is the need for guidance in the spiritual path. A seeker after truth should be blessed with thecompany of his Satguru so that the former may get rid of his defects and develop virtues and attainGodhead.
The company of great men is very rare to be got. The attainment of a Satguru is the result of the
full grace of God. A true spiritual Guru is God Himself.
A disciple should not act against the wishes of his Guru. He should not speak displeasing words
to his Guru. He should view everyone with Guru-Bhava. This is the culmination of Guru-Bhakti.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book A disciple without devotion to his Guru is like a flower without fragrance, a well without water,
a cow without milk or a body without life.
If you want to be a true disciple, you should follow the instructions of your Guru to their very
letter and spirit. If you make a promise to your Guru you should fulfil it even at the cost of your life.
The treasure of Guru-Bhakti is not acquired in a day. The disciple has to cultivate it gradually
and painstakingly. He must increase it day by day. It develops through constant earnest prayers in
the secret chamber of your heart. You must make yourself perfectly blind to the human aspects of
your Guru. Then you will develop true Guru-Bhakti.
Deification of the Guru is a mysterious powerful method of having his grace. When you deify
him, you see only the storehouse of perfection in him. Even if you cannot understand his actions, donot misunderstand them. Be humble and silent. Wait patiently. You will be rewarded with light,later on.
Guru-Bhakti is the magic-wand in the hands of the disciple to cross the ocean of Samsara.
Guru-Bhakti will make possible for you, all that is impossible. The unattainable can be attained by
Guru-Bhakti.
The true disciple is concerned only with the Divine Nature of the Guru. The Guru’s actions as
man, is not the disciple’s concern. He is totally oblivious of it. To him the Guru is Guru, even if heacts unconventionally. Always remember that the nature of a saint is unfathomable. Judge him not.Measure not his divine nature with the inadequate yardstick of your ignorance.
A sincere disciple, who is living with his Guru, should not foolishly sit idle, waiting for verbal
instruction from the Guru every day. The day-to-day conduct of the Guru is in itself a living ideal tohim, who is observant. He must eagerly deserve and learn precious lessons of life from thepersonality and actions of the Guru. The life of Guru is a living sermon to the sincere disciple. TheGuru teaches through personal example. The disciple learns through devout observation.
GURU-BHAKTI IN THE BHAGAVAD GITA
Om Namo Bhagavate Vaasudevaya
We know how Lord Krishna, though He was fully conscious of His Supreme Divinity, served
His Guru and studied under him. What He said was what He did; and what He did was only a
commentary on what He said. Let us, therefore, turn to the Bhagavad Gita, the Immortal Words of
Sri Krishna, to see what He says about one’s attitude to the spiritual preceptor.
“Na hi jnaanena sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate,” said Lord Krishna; there is nothing here so
grand, ennobling and purifying as Knowledge. How can we attain that Knowledge?
There are two statements that answer this great question. “Shraddhaavaan labhate
jnaanam”—”a person who has Shraddha attains Jnana”. This word Shraddha is indeed very
difficult to define; it is a perfect blending of love, faith, devotion, total egolessness and absolutesurrender. The other statement is “ Tadviddhi pranipaatena pari-prasnena sevayaa; Upadekshyanti
te jnaanam jnaaninah tattvadarsinah” ; “Know that by prostrating yourself to, by questioning and
by serving those Great Ones who have had a direct perception of the Self; they will impart that

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book Knowledge to you.” This Knowledge is impossible for one to acquire by one’s own unaided
self-effort.
This truth is clearly brought out in the Visvarupa-Darshana Yoga . After revealing Himself to
Arjuna and after once again assuming the lovely human form of Krishna, the Lord declares: “The
Wondrous Form that you beheld just now, even the gods are ever desirous of witnessing.” The Lordhad already said: “The Devas and the Maharshis know Me not; for I am their very Source.” “But, byAnanya-Bhakti I am capable of being known,” says the Lord. When a person has Ananya Bhakti the
Lord reveals Himself to the devotee, even as He revealed Himself to Arjuna. This is a point worthremembering; even then it is He who reveals Himself. It is only after the Lord gave Arjuna theDivya-Chakshu or the Divine Eye was Arjuna able to behold Him. Similarly, “Dadaami
buddhi-yogam tam yena maamupayaantite” , when the aspirant is ripe for Wisdom, “I give the
Buddhi-Yoga to him and he attains Me.” Even in the crowning declaration of the Gita:“Sarvadharmaan parityajya maamekam sharanam vraja” , the Lord has made it abundantly clear
“Aham tvaa sarva paapebhyo mokshayishyaami maa shuchah.” “Surrender yourself
wholeheartedly, unreservedly and totally to Me; that is all that you can do; I will free you from sins .
You cannot do this yourself. But I will do it, fear not.”
“You can only develop Shraddha; I will give you Jnana. You can only surrender yourself; I will
give you Liberation.” That is the final declaration of the Lord.
A beautiful truth emerges from these passages in the Gita. At one place the Lord says: “I give
the aspirant Buddhi-Yoga and he reaches Me.” At another place he says: “Go to the Great Ones;
(they are your spiritual preceptors); prostrate to them; serve them; and ask of them; they will impartthe Knowledge to you.” Reading the two together we get a glimpse of the grand truth that Guru isGod-incarnate upon earth. You can get at the Truth, you can attain Self-realisation either bycultivating Ananya-Bhakti to the Lord in His Transcendental Formless aspect or in His Immanent
aspect as your own Guru with a Name you can repeat, a Form on which you can meditate, a distinctpersonality which you can see, touch and hear, and which can guide you, inspire you, and lead youto the realisation of your Immortal Self.
Thus has the Lord established His complete identification with the Spiritual Preceptor, the
Guru. And the aspirant can direct his Shraddha andBhakti either to Him in His Formless aspect or
to His Immanent Form upon earth, the Guru, and the latter is certainly more practicable for the vastmajority of the aspirants.
Guru-Bhakti and Guru-Seva terminate (if it can at all be called a termination) in
Self-realisation. You will have to go on serving the Guru. The Guru will reveal the Truth to youwhen your self-surrender is complete, when the time is ripe. But that is not your concern. Even asArjuna prayed for the Visvarupa-Darshana and waited for the Lord to bestow the Divya-Chakshuon him, you will have to serve, serve, and serve, and the Guru will bestow the Knowledge on youwhen you are ripe for It. Some deluded aspirants serve their Guru for some years and then give it upfoolishly imagining that they have attained Chitta-Shuddhi. They do not gain the SupremeKnowledge; they do not reach their Goal. They, no doubt, gain some merit (Punya), butSelf-realisation is not attained: this is indeed a great loss, a great blunder.
Guru-Bhakti and Guru-Seva are like the two oars to the boat of Sadhana that takes you across
the torrential stream of Samsara. You cannot do without them until you reach the other shore, untilyou attain Immortality and Eternal Bliss, until you become a Jivanmukta. Then Guru-Bhakti itself

One who has such a Guru-Bhakti, one who has totally surrendered himself to the Guru, one
who serves the Guru wholeheartedly, knows no grief, no sorrow, no fear, no pain, no misery, no
ignorance and he instantly attains Godrealisation: for, Guru and God are one. He attainsinstantaneous Knowledge and Self-Illumination. Therefore have the Upanishads also declared:“Yasya deve para bhaktiryathaa deve tathaa gurau; Tasyaite kathitaahyarthaah prakaashante

great Mahatma will the truths of the Upanishads be clear as crystal.”

Jivanmuktas in this very birth! May God bless you all with health, long life, peace prosperity and

GURU TATTVA
Just as service done to the father or grandfather pleases the son or grandson, so also service
done to Guru pleases Mantra. Make no distinction between Guru, Mantra and Devata. Guru is God.
He should not be regarded as a mere man. The place where Guru dwells in is Kailasa. The house in
which he lives is Kashi or Banaras. The water of his feet is Ganga herself. The Mantra uttered by his
fair Mouth is the saviour Brahman Himself.
The form of Guru is the root of Dhyana, the Lotus-Feet of Guru is the root of Pooja, the word of
Guru is the root of salvation.
Guru is the place of pilgrimage. Guru is fire. Guru is Surya. Guru is the whole world. All places
of pilgrimage in the entire universe reside in the sole of Guru’s Lotus-Feet. Brahma, Vishnu, Siva,Parvati, Indra, all Devas, all sacred rivers are eternally seated in the Guru’s body. Siva alone isGuru.
There is no difference between Guru and Ishta Devata. He who teaches the various forms of
Sadhana and Yoga is Shiksha Guru or the teaching Guru. Of these two he is the supreme Guru from
whom the great Mantra of Ishta Devata has been heard and learnt and by him alone Siddhi can beattained.
If Guru is pleased, the Lord Himself is pleased; if Guru is displeased, the Lord is displeased.
Guru is grandfather to the Ishta Devata.
He who is pure in thought, word and deed, who has mastery over the senses, who has
knowledge of scriptures, who is truthful, serene and who has God-realisation is a Guru.
A man of bad character cannot be a Guru. Competent disciples are never in want of competent
Gurus. The disciple achieves results in proportion to his faith on his Guru.
The possession of university degrees cannot entitle a man to be an examiner of a Guru.
It is the height of impertinence and foolishness on his part, blinded by the vanity of worldly
knowledge, to test the spiritual knowledge of the Guru.

The ordinary worldly man is like milk. When he comes into contact with wicked people, he gets
lost, irretrievably. Into this very milk, a little bit of buttermilk is poured: then it becomes curd. The
worldly man is initiated by a Guru. The Guru is like the curd: already been complacently
transformed. After adding the buttermilk, the milk is put away for some time. Like that the initiate
also should resort to seclusion and assimilation of the initiation. Then the milk is transformed intocurd: the disciple is transformed into a wise man.
Now the curd will not so readily mix with the water. If water is poured over it, it will sink at the
bottom. Only if the curd is beaten up vigorously, will it mix with water. Similarly, the wise manwhen he gets into wicked company, does not so readily mix with the vicious people; but if theinfluence is very deep, he, too, might be lost. Then, if this curd is well churned, in Brahmamuhurta(before sunrise), you obtain butter from it. Similarly if the wise man meditates deeply on God,during the Brahmamuhurta he gets the butter of Self-knowledge: he becomes the butter of aSelf-realised sage.
This butter can be easily thrown into water. It will not get mixed with water. And, it will float. If
the Self-realised sage comes into contact with worldly people, he will not get lost; on the contrary,
he will float happily unpolluted by worldliness. If this butter is melted and made into ghee, and thenif it is put in water, then it will impart the ghee-flavour to the entire water; similarly, if this sage ismelted by the fire of cosmic love, he will become the ghee of a divine being whose contact purifiesall and who elevates all by his contact, and infuses his wisdom, his glory and his divinity intoeveryone who comes into contact with him.
THE PRECEPTOR AND THE DISCIPLE
(Sri Swami Krishnananda )
However intelligent the seeker may be, it is not possible, except in the very rare cases of the
perfected unworldly beings, for him to grasp the exact technique of meditation on the Ideal of
Attainment. Spiritual knowledge is imparted with the best result, not so much through the precision
of reason and logic, as image, art and beauty. It is the change of the feelings of the heart and notmerely of the understandings of the intellect that touches the being of the inner man. AdhyatmaVidya is the science of the innermost essence of the universe, and it does not come under the
intellectual categories of objective discernment. The teachings of the sages have all had the
conspicuous characteristic of appealing to the whole nature of a person, not merely to an aspect ofhim. The highest teachings are accomplished in the language of the heart of man. The troubles oflife are not alleviated through flowery expressions and subtle hair splitting. The cause of sorrow isrooted in the very make-up of the individual and not only in his superficial coatings. The innerdisease is not cured by washing simply the outer shirt. The root of illness has to be dug out.
The best performance always becomes possible when both the subject and the object effect a
conscious interaction not so much when the effort is exercised by the subject alone. Mind is
objectified universal consciousness. The conscious subject and the conscious object are bothconsciousness stresses differing only in the degree of the subtlety and the expansiveness of their

lower. No action or event is completely subjective or completely objective in the lower limitedsense of their individuality. The truth is midway between the two. Action and reaction are the
subjective and the objective forces simultaneously working, each being intimately connected with
the other. The external and the internal are the two complementary phases of the one whole being.There is no purpose served when there is eye to see but no light, or, when there is light but no eye tosee. The contact of both effects perceptions.
If entire individual subjectively were the truth, the individual would have been the absolute
Lord of the universe and, if the entire objectivity were the truth, no individual could attainliberation, and freedom would be a chimera. The subject and the object have, therefore, equalshares in determining the effect of their interaction. The internal and the external forms of the onepower of being blend together to produce an effect.
This fact well explains the wonderful process of the teacher’s imparting of knowledge to the
disciple. The transformation of the consciousness of the disciple is the joint action of the receptive
capacity and the conscious exertion of the disciple and the consciousness-force of the teachersending it forth. The teacher should be “a Shrotriya and a Brahmanistha”—Mund. Up. I-2-12. Themore potent spiritual energy of the teacher is infused into the less purified mental state of thedisciple which results in the dispelling of the darkness and the enlightening of the mind of the latter.The consciousness of the teacher enters the dark corner in the disciple who bears it with the strengthof truth and purity and receives it to the extent his mind is purged of Rajas and Tamas.
We hear of earnest seekers going to a teacher and imploring, “ Adheehi Bhagavo Brahma” .“ O
great sire, teach me Brahman,” Bhrigu learnt Brahmavidya from his teacher Varuna, Nachiketasfrom Yama, Sukesha and others from Pippalada, Shaunaka from Angirasa, Swetaketu fromUddalaka, Narada from Sanatkumara, Indra from Prajapati, Maitreyi from Yajnavalkya. Thedisciples are generally asked to observe silence and continence in sequestration for many yearsbefore being initiated into the sacred truth. They had a great joy in leading a natural life in isolated
places, practising spiritual penance. The transcendental mystery is not easy to be contemplated
upon amidst the distracting bustles of social life. The distant forests, thick and green, away from thetouch of the air of the business of worldly life, have ever since ages managed to attract lovers ofsilence and peace. The forests breathe a new life, unknown to the common man, and speak in thelanguage of eternity. They seem to be happily unaware of the revolting forces and the bruteconflicts in nature which man so much complains of. In these forests, the seekers spend their time insilent meditation, entirely devoted to the Supreme Reality “Faith continence, austerity andknowledge” (Prasna Up. 1.10) are the watchwords of these blessed ones who practiseSelf-integration with iron-determination. The sincere votaries of Truth, are equipped with all thespiritually ethical qualifications,
“realising that the Not-Done can never be reached through what is done, getting disgust for the
action-bound world,”
went humbly and reverentially to the Preceptor for receiving from him that knowledge which

And to them the glorious Teacher speaks the Knowledge of Brahman.The disciples were “those high-souled ones who had the highest devotion to the Supreme Being,and for their preceptor as much as for the Supreme Being.” To them alone, it is declared, the truthbecomes illumined.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book know the Truth,” compares the one who is without a spiritual guide to a blindfolded man who may
miss his way and reach some other undesirable destination due to his lack of sight. The MundakaUpanishad says that he who is desirous of real prosperity should worship the knower of the Self. No
sophistry of intellect is allowed to hamper the growth of the divine relation that exists between the
Guru and the Sishya.
“Even the gods had doubt as to this, for truly, it is not easy to be known; very subtle is this
matter.” Katha Up. I.21. “He is not easy to be known when told by an inferior person, though (He
may be) expounded about manifoldly; unless declared by another (who is supremely wise), there is
no way (of attaining Him); for He is inconceivably subtler than what is very subtle, andunarguable.” (Katha Up. II. 8.) Even the proud Indra and the great Narada become humble beforetheir teachers; this speaks of the majestic transcendentness of the Absolute, not knowable througheasy means. How innocent and simple was that Satyakama who said to his teacher, when askedabout his parentage.
“Sire, I do not know this, of what family I am; I asked my mother. She told me in reply: ‘I begot
you in my youth when I was wandering much as a servant-maid, and I, being such, do not know this,
of what family you are’”
Then, the teacher inferred that Satyakama must be a Brahmana, telling him that “a
non-Brahmana will not be able to speak thus (the truth)” and accepted him as disciple. Narada bowsdown and says, “O Lord, I am in sorrow; may the Lord take me across sorrow.”
“Not by reasoning is this knowledge to be attained; instructed about by another, it is easy to be
known.” Katha Up. II.9. These make it clear that Self-knowledge cannot be attained by anindividual striving for himself in his ignorance independently without a teacher. None can reach Itby his own personal effort without a proper guide; very mysterious and subtle is it. Book-learning isdead knowledge; the knowledge which directly comes from the teacher is a dynamicconsciousness-power. With regard to this it is said, “The father should speak the knowledge ofBrahman to the eldest son or a worthy pupil; not to anyone else; even if one should offer him this
sea-girt (earth) filled with its treasures verily, (he should consider that) this (knowledge) is greater
than that: verily, this is greater than that.” Chh. Up. III-11-5.
The initiation is only a matriculation of the pupil in the spiritual current but the actual effort to
soar high into the Absolute is to be exercised by him with the grace of the preceptor throughprotracted “meditation which is the firm restraining of the senses, with vigilance and non-pride forthe meditative condition comes and goes.” Katha Up. VI. 11.
There is no greater error than spiritual pride. Even the state of high meditation is transitory, it
passes away quickly. Let there be no pride, no conceit, even if one may feel that he is about to befinally liberated. The light of discrimination should always be kept bright.
When the process of practice is perfect, there quickly comes the highest experience of the
Reality.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book HOW TO OBTAIN GURU-KRIPA
Swami Chidanandaji’s Speech on 2nd September, 1952.
Revered Immortal Selves,
I shall just put before you all a few worship words, especially as today is most auspicious to the
divinity manifest as the Guru. Therefore I shall speak on Guru and Guru Kripa. Here in this Ashram
we are looking at Guru and Guru-Kripa topsy-turvy. Guru serves the disciple; and the disciple givesinstruction to the Guru and he has to obey. If this is true, then I think we have to try to once again set
right this topsy-turvy attitude.
We have been told by our scriptures that Guru-Kripa is a wonderful, mysterious factor, that will
enable the aspirants to seek and to attain the summum bonum of life, Self-realisation, Darshan of
God, Moksha or whatever it is; whether the disciple does Sadhana or not, whether he is deserving or
undeserving, the Guru-Kripa sets aside all normal laws that operate in the spiritual self and takesone to the transcendental bliss. If we are to believe the scriptures, we should say that besidesGuru-Kripa there is nothing needed for us to attain perfection in life.
Side by side, if this factor also is true that Guru is an Infinite Ocean of Mercy, that His Kripa
ever showers upon all seekers whether they are worthy or unworthy, whether they are qualified or
not, then by this time we must all have been already Apta-Kamas full of Bliss. Is that so? No. Wefind very much to our vexation that we are caught up: ignorance is there; illusion is there; we aredeceived at every turn by our own lower self.
Wherein lies the defect? Which is the untruth? If both the above statements are true and yet
disciples are still very much earth-earthy, something else must be wrong somewhere else. What isthat something else? We don’t have the temerity to say that the scriptures are untrue. At the sametime, we do not also assert that the Guru is not compassionate, the Guru does not shower his Kripaupon us.
If we reflect upon this some factors come up before us which are worthy of serious
consideration. Guru Kripa is undeniably a divine force that can turn even a stone into the InfiniteSatchidananda, leave alone a conscious being. There is absolutely not the least bit of exaggerationin the statement and the fact that the Guru is always gracious. But, then, Guru-Kripa has not only tobe bestowed, not only to be given; but it has also to be received. In receiving it, we immortaliseourselves; divinise ourselves.
Unlimited charity may be bestowed by a generous-hearted donor who calls upon all who are in
need to come and take. But not all the wealth of the world will be of any avail to an indigent one if hewill not avail himself of this great opportunity and become a receiver. And therefore it is that thegreat Lord Jesus said: “Seek and it shall be found; knock and it shall open unto you; ask and it shallbe given.” It was not as there was any dearth of the divine munificence, divine grace or Guru-Kripa.Light was not lacking; but then there was a Law that we have to ask, we have to seek and we have toknock and having done it we must be ready to receive it. If this is present, then Guru-Kripa is all thewonders; it will flow into us and raise us to the highest realm of immortality, eternal light andinfinite bliss.
But, then, how can we receive it? How should we conduct ourselves if we are to be ready to
receive this Grace? By discipleship. For, the question of Guru and Guru-Kripa arises only for the

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book disciple. For such as are not of the category named disciple, it is not denied that mercy, compassion,
grace and Ashirvad will not be given; but not Guru-Kripa. When I say Guru-Kripa, it is somethingspecial, something mysterious, something that bestows not anything merely of this earth, but gives
the Highest Thing for which human life is there for. For a devotee may get the Ashirvad of a saint,
the Kripa of a saint. He may also be blessed. He may also partake of the power of his compassion.But, for the attainment of the gift of Guru-Kripa, we have first to be disciples. Then alone have wetaken the first step to qualify to become a proper recipient.
How is it that one may be a disciple? It is not the Guru that accepts the disciple; but the disciple
has to first accept the Guru. If the disciple has first of all to render himself the Sishya, it isimmaterial whether the Guru says “Yes, you are my Sishya” or does not; he becomes deserving ofand a rightful claimant to Guru-Kripa.
We have to understand what the sacred thing disciple, constitutes. In asmuchas Guru-Kripa
takes us to the Highest State, discipleship is qualifying ourselves to receive that highest state or therealisation of ourselves as Satchidananda. Therefore, first of all, we have to feel that our present
state is something which is not part of our real nature, which is something undesirable, somethingwhich we have to get rid of, and that then alone we shall have peace, happiness. Let us reflect andanalyse: how many of us have got this feeling. When I say our present state, I mean our present stateas the Jiva, Spirit enmeshed in a very agonising cage of flesh and bone. How many of us feel that weare in a cage stifled, not able to breathe freely, and sincerely wish to break out of this cage? If wehave this feeling, then we are trying to grow into discipleship. Then we can approach the FreedOne; for the Guru is the Freed One and One capable of freeing us also. If we feel this pain and thisagony of Jivatva, then we approach this Freed One and pray to him: “Oh, free us from this body.”This prayer may not be expressed or articulated; but this prayer must ever be recited from theinnermost core of our being, every moment of our life. Then alone can we expect Guru-Kripa. Ifthis pain and agony are not there, it is worthwhile trying to generate them. But, such is the coveringwall of dark Maya that we are perfectly satisfied with our position! To feel the necessity of Mukti,Freedom, Divine Consciousness of the Higher Spiritual Life, we should resort to Satsanga, to study
of scriptures, and we should paint vividly before our mental eye, the wretchedness of human life on
earth. These things will generate Mumukshutva. Mumukshutva is the first step if we have even tothink of Guru-Kripa. If we do not have this fiery Mumukshutva, let us not think of Guru-Kripa. Letus not talk about Guru-Kripa. We are unworthy.
First of all acquire this Mumukshutva. Then we have to serve the Guru. Service is that
mysterious something which pulls down the barrier that stands between us and the influence ofGuru Kripa. For, if we have to be the proper receivers, it is service that removes the obstacles to thisBhava of the receiver. Ego is the greatest barrier. Our old set of self-conceit, preconceived notions,these form another formidable second barrier. For all this service is the effective barrier-breaker.
What is service of the Guru? Service of the Guru is to try our level best to carry out his
Upadesh. Carry out the teachings of the Guru. Upon his sublime instructions we have to mould ourlife. We should also try to mould ourselves into that pattern which he himself is a visible ideal of.What is the secret of carrying out the instructions of the Guru to our humble best; it is a willingobedience of spirit. That is the most important thing. Readiness to bow completely down to earth.Accept him as the leader and obey him. This obedience should be assiduously cultivated: for, everyaspect of our old nature, of our lower nature, our mental part, our Indriya, Antahkarana, try to seethat we are prevented from developing this spirit of obedience because every time we move towards

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book this attitude of obedience, the prompting will come from our old habit from our preconceived
notions, “Let us go the way to which we have been accustomed.” This instinct of ages has to beovercome and broken down. There must be joy in obedience to the Guru and there should be a real
craving in the spirit that “ I should obey.” To be a disciple, you should obey even in dream; the idea
of doing anything which is contrary to the spirit of the Guru’s Upadesh should never arise in ourconsciousness. Day and night our Sadhana should be to cultivate this attitude to perfection. If this isdone, we are sufficiently on the way to qualify ourselves to receive Guru-Kripa. This is the external
part of the Sadhana.
Inwardly we have also to break down the old set of ideas which somehow or other has crept into
us regarding the Guru, His Grace and its functions; what is GuruKripa and its function. It is a hard
task. But this task has to be done. Because, to the disciple, the nature of the Guru is not human. Weshould be blind completely to the human side of the Guru and we should be conscious only of thedivinity that he is. Then alone will we be able to partake of this Kripa which will transform us fromthe lower human into the transcendental divine. Our relationship with the Guru is purely divine,purely spiritual; and as long as we have not completely rubbed out the least vestige of human
relationship with the Guru, we shall not be able to enter into the divine spiritual relation with theGuru. For being our Guru, we expect that he should relieve us of small troubles, bodily ills,financial difficulties, domestic problems, little paltry matters of this earthly life. We will get all thatif we pray to the Guru. But that is all that you will get; nothing beyond that! No, that mysteriouslofty thing called Guru Kripa—that will not flow into us. Therefore, first of all we shall try to effaceall human relationships with the Guru. For that, subjectively, we have to work out an innertransformation; until that is done, his divine nature will not become fully revealed to us. As long aswe consider ourselves to be human beings, earthly beings with all the wants, limitations andweaknesses of earthly beings, we cannot fully enter into the awareness of the Guru in his absolute,divine essence. Therefore, our Sadhana should be to generate the divine consciousness and shed offfirst our human consciousness. If we begin to live here as divine beings with a divine destiny, thengradually the Guru-Kripa and the divine aspect of the Guru will begin to manifest, and we shallbegin to partake of the Guru-Kripa.
We have to make the start. Even in this prayer to the Guru will make our task easy. From the
very beginning to the very climax, all have to be got from the divine source. Until we makeourselves fit and generate the divine consciousness that we are not the human beings, but we aresouls in bondage who only need a little transforming touch of Guru-Kripa, we will not be able tofully make use of the Guru as the divine being.
To illustrate this point: A prince who has lost his heritage does not know that he is a prince,
happens in his wanderings to stand before his father’s palace, being cowed down in theconsciousness of a beggar. What is the maximum he will ask? He will ask: Give me shelter fornight, give me food for the day. And, that is what he will get. Supposing this very prince is made torealise: ‘You are the heir to the kingdom’; then he will demand the whole kingdom. He will notdemand food and shelter. He will go up to the king and say: O father! Make me king. Give me myheritage.
Similarly, we have first of all to develop in us the consciousness that we are immortal beings,
we are in essence Satchidananda. Then we can demand that Satchidananda-consciousness fromGuru and Guru will be able to give.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book Ultimately, we have to take consideration of one more factor. Even if someone were to tell the
prince that he is a prince and he is to go to his father and demand the heritage, perhaps, if he is a
minor, the king may say: All right, give him a palace, and he will become entitled to his heritage, the
kingdom, when he attains majority. Even so, there may be certain inner qualifications which are
necessary for the full and effective reception of divine grace; until that is attained by the disciple, hewill have to wait. Therefore, even after having seemingly attained all the qualifications of the idealdisciple, we have to wait in humility and in patience. We cannot arrogate to ourselves a perfection
which is only visible to the discerning vision of a divine light. Patience and humility in the spiritual
realm may have to extend over a period of a decade. We have to wait as a dog at the doorstep of theGuru for a whole lifetime, if need be. There is no loss here. For the goal is immortal life, freedom.
If we have become willing servants and willing obedient disciples, then it is the natural law that
Guru Kripa will flow into us unasked. But, let us not commit the mistake of dictating to the Guruhow his Kripa should flow into us. For, we have within ourselves desires, our own old traits andambitions, our own ideas of what is good and bad, what is pleasant and unpleasant, desirable andundesirable; and we want Guru Kripa to conveniently adjust and adapt itself to our needs and
fancies. Guru-Kripa may come in an unpleasant form. It may come in the form of a series ofdisappointments. We may think that Guru has not bestowed his Kripa upon us; but, thatdisappointment itself will be his Kripa! Many things may be seemingly good and pleasant; but itmay be heartful to our own spirit; and that the Guru alone can perceive and judge. As a fond carefulmother, he may deny us that desire, by subjecting us to seeming cruel disappointments. But it willbe the greatest manifestation of Guru-Kripa, meant to remove all the obstacles and dangers that areon our path, and to take us nearer and nearer to the consciousness of Satchidananda. We are not fitto judge whether we are ready to receive Guru-Kripa or not and what form it would take.
The best thing is to humbly leave everything to the Guru. “I do not know whether I am even a
disciple or not. Therefore O Ocean of Mercy and Compassion, pray, make me a proper disciple.Generate in me that Mumukshutva which makes me a disciple and give me the spirit of willingobedience. Help me in trying to follow thy instructions. Help me in trying to mould myself upon thepattern set up by thee”—this must be our constant prayer. And, by this alone shall we be able todraw the Kripa of our Guru and make our life fruitful. And the perfect way of praying is trying outbest to be real disciples.

Swami Chidanandaji’s Guru-Purnima speech
We are indeed thrice blessed today. Already we are extremely blessed in that in this life itself
we have had the unique and indescribable good fortune of having attained to the Lotus-Feet of our
divine master Sadgurudev Sri Swami Sivanandaji,—a blessing whose magnitude is hardly realised
even by us. Whether we know it or not, we have been so fortunate in having come to be his disciplesthat I feel that it is a great fortune that even the gods envy.
In this blessed life of ours at his feet, trying to follow in his footsteps today we are even more
blessed because we have had a special chance of offering our adorations and worship to him in anintimate and personal way and receiving his blessings upon this most auspicious day of the GuruPurnima.
To be near him, living under his benign guidance, is such a great blessing that it is given only to
one in a million among mortals, out of great merit done in countless past lives. Therefore, it is agreat responsibility placed upon us to strive to realise the full meaning of this Vara Daana that has
been bestowed upon us by the Lord and strive our sincere best to prove ourselves worthy of this
divine Grace.
As a part of the Puja and the adoring worship which we offer to his divine feet this day, a few
words upon this subject of worship of the Divine are being spoken.
This is a day of Puja. It is called Vyasa Puja or Guru Puja. As it happens to fall on a Purnima
day, it is also called Guru Purnima or Vyasa Purnima. It is a day of very solemn, significant andexalted worship.
Worship is conceived of in different ways by people in different states of consciousness, in
different stages of evolution. The earliest savage worshipped anything that was awesome, andfearful, that appeared to be terribly strong and something over which he had no control, e.g.thunder, rain, sun, ocean, mountain and fire.
At a later time, man created fanciful objects and endowed them with some qualities and a
glorified personality with his own imagination and tried to worship these objects—anythingbeautiful, even smooth stones.
At a still different stage of evolution the conception of a higher power, a supreme intelligence at
the back of all phenomena, came to be slowly grasped. It resulted in Saakara worship, because eventhough the human mind was able to grasp this conception of a Supreme Power, that stage had notyet been reached when this power in its formless, nameless, attributeless, transcendent aspect wasunderstood. It was the Personal God aspect of this Impersonal Being that was worshipped. TheAvataras were there. Images were made of the different deities, and elaborate ritualistic worship ofthese deities with flowers, sweet smelling sandal paste, waving of lights and offering of deliciousNaivedya was undertaken. A vast majority of persons still prefer and feel inclined to this sort offormal worship of the personal deity.
There are still others who conceive of this deity, not as an objectified physical material form;
but they regard it as being enshrined in their own hearts, with form, perhaps, but yet as seated in theheart-lotus. They sit in silence and try to do Manasic Puja.

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book There are yet others who, with their mystic sense opened up, dispense with the elaborate ritual
even in their Manasic Puja. Their worship, consists of the mere repetition of the Divine Name. That
itself, they feel, is a sufficient and a comprehensive, integral worship. They conceive it to be an
even higher form than elaborate worship with different Angas. Japa is a much simpler and more
direct form of worship.
The worship of others takes a still higher form where even the Japa is eliminated and they
concentrate upon Divinity alone—to think of It continuously in an unbroken stream of
remembrance. They find delight in this sort of worship alone.
Still higher up in the ladder of evolution, the sages declare that the best form of worship is direct
perception of the Divinity, in Samadhi, to rise beyond the mind (and, therefore, concentration and
meditation which are after all mental processes), to go into the supra mental state of intuition, and tobe intensely conscious of the Deity while in direct communion with It.
Thus we have numerous conceptions of the selfsame processes of offering our adoration, love,
reverence and worship to the Supreme Being from the most externalised one to the highest subtle
purely subjective type, culminating in the transcendental worship of direct perception or Samadhi.What is the type of worship that we, as disciples at the feet of a Sat-Guru, should try to offer untohim? How is our worship of the Guru classified? What is the peculiarity of the worship offered bythe individual soul to the enlightened soul, so that through this worship the bound individual soulmay draw the strength of the enlightened soul, draw the Grace of the Supreme Satchidananda andattain release from birth and death?
I shall remind you of two statements: (1) Devo Bhutwaa Devam Aaaraadhayet —having
become God one should worship the Deity, having become divine one should worship divinity: (2)Brahmavid Brahmaiva Bhavati —One who realises the Supreme Being himself becomes That. If
we are to offer our adoration and worship to the Sat-Guru in the most effective and worthy manner,then we have to consciously, earnestly and determinately strive to the best of our ability to makeourselves into the same nature as he is. It is the great duty of every disciple to do all that he can to tryhis utmost to develop within himself those divine qualities which shine in all their resplendencethrough the spiritual personality of the divine master. This is the highest form of Sadhana—the oneimportant and most effective form of Sadhana, which the great monk Thomas A. Kempis of Europehas referred to when he speaks about the imitation of Christ. He was a follower of Jesus the Christand he has given a memorable work of worshipping and following the teachings of Jesus in the formof the Imitation of Christ.
It is this endeavour to grow into the likeness of the idealistic personality of the Sat-Guru in all
its beautiful aspects which is the first and foremost duty of the disciple-Sadhana. To the extent towhich we succeed through our sincerity, humility, constant unbroken endeavour in thus graduallytransforming ourselves into the master’s divine personality, to that extent will we be worthy ofworshipping the master. Sat-Guru Puja can best be done by our trying to image within ourselves theSat-Guru Swaroopa. All the Divya-Sadgunas that emanate as the fragrance of the Guru’spersonality must become a part and parcel of our struggling personality. Then alone will weapproach that state when we will be fit to offer our adorations to the Sat-Guru.
We should constantly meditate upon his superhuman personality. We should try to emulate his
example by devoutly observing his day-to-day activities and his actions. We should try to grow intohis likeness by constantly praying to him to reveal to us more and more the glory of his nature and to

Contact pannir@dlshq.org if you purchased this book bless us with the ability to approach him closer and closer, by practically living the ideals which he
holds before us and by actively carrying out the teachings that he gives us.
This is done because of the law that he whom we worship and through such worship realise,
that we ourselves become. Even so, one who worships and realises the true glory of an illumined
and emancipated personality such as the divine Sat-Guru is, himself in turn becomes illumined andemancipated. We know that the very aim of our discipleship, the very purpose of spiritual life is toattain illumination and attain eternal emancipation from birth and death. Therefore, we must strive
our sincere best to live this law. Through making ourselves by devout emulation and imitation fit to
worship the divine master, we must worship him. And thus, through that worship we should realisehim. And, realising him we shall for ever be free and attain to the glorious state of Jivanmukti whichis exemplified in the living personality of the divine master.
This Guru Puja, this worship of the Divine Master, is on a par with the Supreme type of worship
with direct perception in Samadhi already referred to. For the Guru is actually God himself invisible manifest form. The Sat-Guru is not merely like God, but HE IS God. “Guruh saakshaat
Para Brahma” is the great and deeply significant Truth. The correct grasp of this truth is the key to
real discipleship. This correct grasp and understanding comes to the seeker mainly through
Guru-Kripa or the Grace of the Divinity that is the Satguru. To draw down this indispensable graceis the central purpose and aim of adoration and worship of the Master. Guru Puja is for Guru-Kripaby which alone it becomes possible for you to realise the Guru as Supreme Akhanda Ekarasa
Satchidananda . Guru Puja is, therefore, Para Puja. It is the Highest Worship of the Supreme Being
direct and face to face. Such worship is the surest means to Illumination. This is the Truth.
We pray to the great Adi Gurus and the divine feet of Sat-Gurudev that they may give us the
necessary strength, the illumination and the inspiration to day by day grow more and more into hisdivine likeness. We pray that he may bless us to thus make ourselves fit for his worship and throughhis worship, to attain illumination. May the blessings of Sat Guru be upon you all. And, let us hopethat in this very life, we may fulfil the supreme purpose of this rare and precious human birth, and
attain Self-realisation. May we make the best use of this unique blessed opportunity that has been
given to us in the form of discipleship to Sat Guru Bhagavan Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj andthus may our life soon flower into bliss, illumination and blessedness.
