PUBLISHERS(cid:146) NOTE

Doubt in the very existence of God has been raised in the mind of the common man, by the
evil-doers for fulfilling their nefarious ends. The modern atheist has his omnipotent and omniscient
scientific research laboratory; and that whose existence cannot be proved there does not exist!

Once this faith in the existence of God is shaken, man loses his moorings and is thrown at

the mercy of all kinds of evil forces, within and without.

Sage Sivananda has proclaimed the existence of God and the soul-force behind his Word
has awakened the faith in millions of people all over the world. He has brought forth interesting
illustrations and illuminating logic to support his declaration, to convince even a confirmed atheist
of the existence of God. They have all been brought together in this volume which is a boon to the
spiritual propagandist,
the teacher, and people all over the world(cid:151)the believers and the
non-believers.

1st August, 1958.

GOD EXISTS, SO WHAT?

Deep reflection over what I have said in this book would convince even a confirmed atheist

that God exists.

(cid:147)Yes, I believe God exists,(cid:148) you say: (cid:147)What should I do about it?(cid:148)

Endeavour to realise Him.

He must be more real to you than all the objects of the world.

For that you must serve humanity and love God. Meditate on Him in Brahmamuhurta.

Sing Kirtan.

Do Japa.

Be truthful; cheat not anybody.

Love all; harm not anybody.

May God bless you!

Lead a virtuous life, for He is the witness of all your thoughts, words and deeds.

Be kind to all; for God dwells in all. And, thus realise Him here and now.

SWAMI SIVANANDA.

GOD EXISTS

GOD EXISTS

1.

I

Every breath that flows in the nose,
Every beat that throbs in the heart,
Every artery that pulsates in the body,
Every thought that arises in the mind,
Speaks to you that God is near.

Every flower that wafts fragrance,
Every fruit that attracts you,
Every gentle breeze that blows,
Every river that smoothly flows,
Speaks of God and His mercy.

The vast ocean with its powerful waves,
The Mighty Himalayas with its glaciers,
The bright Sun and stars in the wide sky,
The lofty tree with its branches,
The cool springs in the hills and dales,
Tell me of His omnipotence.

The melody of sweet music,
The oration of powerful orators,
The poems of reputed poets,
The inventions of able scientists,
The operations of dexterous surgeons,
The utterances of holy saints,
The thoughts of the Bhagavad Gita,
The revelations of the Upanishads,
Speak of God and His wisdom,

GOD EXISTS

II

Atheist want proofs for the existence of God. Can they give proof for the non-existence of

God? No one has succeeded in showing proofs that God does not exist.

Even many educated men now say boldly that there is no God, that everything in this world
goes on and evolves according to definite laws. Can law arise by itself? Can any law come out of
nothing? Surely there must be an ultimate cause. That is God. That is the supreme Brahman or the
Absolute. God is self-existent Being. He is infinitely powerful, wise and good.

The notion of God means an absolutely perfect being. An absolutely perfect being must

have all the positive attributes, including the attributes of existence. So God must exist.

The existence of God cannot be proved by scientific experimentation. It is purely a question

of faith and refers to the intuitive side of man.

The deepest craving, the deepest aspiration in man is for eternal happiness, eternal
knowledge and eternal Truth. Man should search for some supernatural entity which can satisfy his
deepest cravings and aspirations.

As we explain everything within Nature by the law of cause and effect, so also Nature as a
whole must be explained. It must have some cause. This cause must be different from the effect. It
must be some supernatural entity, i.e., God.

Nature is not a mere chance collection of events, a mere jumble of accidents, but an orderly
affair. The planets move regularly in their orbits, seeds grow into trees regularly, the seasons
succeed each other in order. Now Nature cannot order itself. It requires the existence of an
intelligent being, i.e., God, who is responsible for it. Even Einstein, the great scientist, was strongly
convinced of the creation of the universe by a Supreme Intelligence.

Everything in Nature has some purpose. It fulfils some function or other. Certainly every
object by itself cannot choose a function for itself. Their different functions ought to have been
planned or designated by a single intelligent Being or God.

Albeit everything is transitory in this world, people purchase enormous plots of land, build
bungalows in various places and erect five-storied houses. They want to establish eternal life in this
sense-universe. This shows that man is essentially immortal. In spite of the knowledge that
everyone has to die, man thinks that he will live for ever and makes very grand arrangements to live
here perpetually. Further, nobody wants death. Everybody wants to live, and takes treatment when
ill, spending any amount. Hence, the essential nature of man should be eternal existence.

Even a fool thinks that he is wise. Everyone wants to show that he knows more than others.
Nobody likes to be called a fool. Children tease their parents with various sorts of questions. The
desire to know is ingrained in them. These indicate that our essential nature is knowledge.

GOD EXISTS

When a man laughs, people seldom ask why he is laughing. On the other hand when a man
cries, everybody asks why he is crying. This shows that our essential nature is bliss. No one wants
misery, but everyone wants happiness, and all one(cid:146)s activities in life are directed towards the
acquisition of happiness. This also proves that our real nature is bliss. In deep sleep when there are
no objects, senses or mind, we feel bliss; hence our essential nature should be bliss. That again is the
reason why people ailing from painful maladies even desire to give up their bodies and thus get rid
of the pain.

If everyone then is of the nature of existence-knowledge-bliss, there should be an
all-pervading principle having these characteristics and different from the perishable, inert,
pain-giving
is
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss(Sat-Chit-Ananda).

Therefore, Brahman

or God, whose

physical

bodies.

nature

The existence of God or the Self is determined or indicated by the existence of the Upadhis
limiting adjuncts, viz., body, mind, Prana and the senses, because there must be

or
self-consciousness behind their activities.

You always feel that, despite your possessions and all sorts of comforts, you are in want of
something. There is no sense of fullness. Only if you add to yourself the all-full God, you will have
fullness.

When you do an evil action, you are afraid. Your conscience pricks you. This also proves

that God exists and witnesses all your thoughts and actions.

To define Brahman is to deny Brahman. The only adequate description of Brahman is a
series of negatives. That is the reason why the sage Yajnavalkya declares in the (cid:145)Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad(cid:146) about Brahman as neti, neti, or (cid:145)not this(cid:146), (cid:145)not this.(cid:146) This means that the residue left
after sublating the names and forms is Brahman.

Brahman or the Self or the Immanent God cannot be demonstrated as He is beyond the reach
of the senses and mind but His existence can be inferred by certain empirical facts or common
experiences in daily life.

Sometimes you are in a peculiar dilemma or pressing pecuniary difficulty. Help comes to
you in a mysterious manner. You get the money just in time. Most of you might have experienced
this. You exclaim at that moment in joy (cid:147)God(cid:146)s ways are mysterious indeed; I have got now full
faith in God. Up to this time I had no faith in God.(cid:148)

An advocate had no faith in God. He developed double pneumonia. His breath stopped. His
wife, son and relatives began to weep. But he had a mysterious experience. The messengers of
Yama caught hold of him and brought him to the court of Lord Yama. Lord Yama said to his
messengers: (cid:147)This is not the man I wanted. You have brought a wrong person. Send him off.(cid:148) He
began to breathe after some time. He actually experienced that he left the body, went to the court of

IV

GOD EXISTS

Yama and again re-entered his physical body. This astonishing experience changed his entire
nature. He developed an intense faith in God and became a religious man.

Another educated person had a similar experience, but there was some change in this case.
He was also an atheist. His soul was brought by the messengers of Yama to his court. This person
asked Yama: (cid:147)I have not finished my work in the physical plane. I have to do still more useful work.
Kindly spare my life now.(cid:148) His boon was granted. He was struck with wonder on this strange
experience. His nature also was entirely changed. He left his job at once. He devoted the remaining
portion of his life in selfless service and meditation. He is still living in South India.

You find that even the world(cid:146)s best doctors fail to cure a dying king. You might have also
heard of many instances where patients ailing from the worst type of diseases are cured
miraculously where even the ablest doctors have declared the cases hopeless. This itself is a clear
proof that there is the divine hand behind all cures.

Sometimes you cannot tolerate the company of persons. You wish to remain alone. You go
to a solitary place,(cid:151)in a garden or on the banks of a river,(cid:151)and enjoy the inner peace. This gives
the clue that you are, in essence, an embodiment of peace, that you are alone and identical with
Brahman.

Some people die when they are eighty years old; some die when they are in the womb; some
die at twenty; some at forty. What is the cause for the variation? Who has fixed the span of life for
all? This clearly proves that there is the theory of Karma, that there is one Omniscient Lord, who is
the dispenser of the fruits of the actions of the Jivas, who fixes the span of life of the Jivas in
accordance with their nature of Karma or actions, who knows the exact relation between Karmas
and their fruits. As Karma is Jada or insentient, it certainly cannot dispense with the fruits of their
actions.

Whether the owl accepts the presence of light or not, there is always light. Whether you
accept the existence of God or not, He always exists. He is ever shining in the (cid:145)three periods of
time.(cid:146) He exists before you begin to search for Him. He is closer to you than your breath and nearer
to you than your hands and feet.

Do you exist or not? This is my question. If you say (cid:145)No,(cid:146) I see before my eyes your figure
with sinewy arms, a broad forehead and big eyes. If you say, (cid:145)Yes,(cid:146) this gives the clue to prove the
existence of God. The very question whether God exists or not clearly proves that God exists.

Whatever you see is God. Whatever you hear is God. Whatever you taste is God. Whatever
you smell is God. Whatever you feel is God. This is the manifested aspect. The physical body
belongs to the Virat (cosmos). The astral body belongs to Hiranyagarbha (cosmic intelligence). The
causal body belongs to Ishwara (Reality with its veiling power). Where is this (cid:147)I(cid:148) now?

Emerson says: (cid:147)A little consideration of what takes place around us everyday would show
us that a higher law than that of our will, regulates events; that our painful labours are very
unnecessary and altogether fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we
strong, and by contending ourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love will relieve

4

GOD EXISTS

us of a vast load of care. O my brothers! God exists. There is a soul at the centre of nature and over
the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe. It has so infused its strong
enchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice; and when we struggle to wound
its creatures, our hands are glued to our sides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of
things goes to teach us faith.(cid:148)

Can you tell me, friend: Is there anyone on the face of the earth who is not afraid of death? Is
there any one who is not uttering the name of the Lord when he is in serious difficulty, when his life
is trembling in the balance or when he is in acute agony? Why, then do deny the existence of God?
You yourself admit His existence when you are in trouble. On account of perverted intellect and
worldly intoxication you have turned out to be an atheist, though, to be sure, you cannot prove His
non-existence, by any means. Is this not a great folly? Think seriously. Give up arguing. Remember
Him and attain immortality and eternal peace.

WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE IN GOD ?

If we have no faith in God, we will be born again and again in this world and will undergo
considerable miseries. The ignorant, faithless, doubting self goes to destruction. He cannot enjoy
the least happiness. Neither this world, nor that beyond is there for the doubting self. Those who
have no faith in God do not know what is right and what is wrong. They have lost the power of
discrimination. They are untruthful, proud and egoistic. They are given to excessive greed, wrath
and lust. They hoard up money by unlawful means. They become men of demoniacal nature. They
commit various sorts of atrocious crimes. They have no ideals for their lives. They are thrown into
the lowest depths, deluded, birth after birth.

Belief in God is an indispensable requisite for every human being. It is a sine qua non.
Owing to the force of Avidya or ignorance pain appears as pleasure. The world is full of is full of
miseries, troubles, difficulties and tribulations. The world is a ball of fire. The mind charged with
attachment, hatred, anger, jealousy, is a blazing furnace. We have to free ourselves from birth,
death, old age, disease and grief. This can only be done by faith in God. There is no other way.
Money and power cannot give us real happiness. Even if we exercise suzerainty over whole world,
we cannot be free from care, worry, anxiety, fear, disappointment, etc. It is only the faith in God and
the consequent God-realisation through meditation that can give us real, eternal happiness and free
us from all kinds of fear and worries which torment us at every moment. Faith in God will force us
to think of Him constantly and to meditate on Him and will eventually lead us on to God-realisation.

Belief in God and God-realisation will give us Param Shanti (Supreme Peace). In that peace
comes the extinction of all pains. We will be no longer bewildered. We will be released from the
bondage of actions. We will become immortal. We will obtain eternal Divine Wisdom. We will
reach a place whence there is no return to this world of miseries, our sins being dispelled by Divine
Wisdom. Our minds will ever remain balanced. We will never rejoice on obtaining what is pleasant

2.

5

GOD EXISTS

nor feel sorry on obtaining what is unpleasant. We will have a cool mind. We will be ever
established in the Divine Consciousness. We will get (cid:145)Akshaya Sukha,(cid:146) (cid:145)happiness exempt from
decay.(cid:146) We will become one with God and get eternal (Nitya), infinite (Ananta), supreme bliss.
When we are established in the Divine Consciousness, we will not be shaken even by heavy sorrow.
We will get (cid:145)Atindriya Sukha,(cid:146) (cid:145)happiness beyond the reach of the senses.(cid:146)

God will give us full security if we worship Him with unswerving devotion and undivided
attention. He gives us the Yoga of discrimination to enable us to reach Him easily. Out of pure
compassion for us He destroys the ignorance born darkness by the shining lamp of Wisdom. He
speedily lifts us from the ocean of Samsara (birth and death), if we fix our minds on Him steadily
with devotion and faith. We will cross over the three qualities and liberated from birth, death, old
age and sorrow, and drink the nectar of immortality. By devotion and faith we will know Him in
essence and will enter into His very Being. Through His Grace we will overcome all obstacles.

WHO IS GOD ?

God is Satchidananda (Existence Absolute, Knowledge Absolute and Bliss Absolute). God
is Truth. God is the Light of lights. God is all-pervading intelligence or consciousness. God is
all-pervading Power who governs this universe and keeps it in perfect order. He is the Inner Ruler of
this body and mind (Antaryamin). He is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent.

He exists,(cid:151)past, present and future. He is unchanging amidst the changing phenomena. He
is permanent amidst the impermanent, and imperishable amidst the perishable things of this world.
He is eternal, perpetual, indestructible, immutable and imperishable. He has created this world
through the three Gunas(cid:151)Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas(cid:151)for His own Leela (play). He has Maya under
His control.

He is Swatantra or independent. He has good desires (satkama) and pure will (satsankalpa).
He dispenses the fruits of actions of the Jivas. He is all-merciful. He quenches the thirst of the Jivas.
He satiates our hunger. It is through His power you see, hear and talk. Whatever you see is God.
Whatever you hear is God. God works through. your hands and eats through your mouth. On
account of sheer ignorance and Abhimana (egoism) you have totally forgotten Him.

Eternal Happiness and Supreme Peace can be had only in God. That is the reason why
sensible, intelligent, aspirants attempt to have God-realisation. God-realisation can bring an end to
the ever-revolving wheel of births and deaths and bestow supreme happiness on mankind. This
world is really a long, long dream. It is indeed a jugglery of Maya. The five senses delude you at
every moment. Open your eyes. Learn to discriminate. Understand His mysteries. Feel His
Presence everywhere as well as His nearness. He dwells in the chamber of your own heart. He is the

3.

I

6

WHO IS GOD ?

silent witness of your mind. He is the Sutradhara or the holder of the string of your Prana. He is the
womb for this world and the Vedas. He is the prompter of thought. Search Him inside your heart
and obtain His Grace. Then alone you have lived your life well. Then alone you are a man. Then
alone you are truly wise. Quick, quick. There is not a moment to waste, not a minute to delay. Now
is the time, or never will it come.

God is love. He is an embodiment of eternal bliss, supreme peace and wisdom. He is
all-merciful, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. He has neither beginning nor end. He is the
Supreme Being or Paramatma. The Gita styles Him as Purushottama or Supreme Purusha or
Maheswara. He knows everything in detail (Sarva-vid). He is the support for this world, body,
mind, senses and Prana. Without Him not an atom can move. He is the womb for the Vedas. Indra,
Agni, Varuna, Vayu and Yama are His assistants. Earth, water, fire, air and ether are His five
powers. Maya is His illusive Shakti (power).

God is Swayambhu, self-existent. He does not depend upon others for His existence. He is
Swayam Prakasha or Swayam Jyoti, self-luminous. He does not want any light to reveal Him. He
reveals Himself by His own light. God is Swatah Siddha, self-proved. He does not want any proof,
because He is the basis for the act or process of proving. God is Paripoorna, self-contained. He
contains everything in Himself. The entire universe is in Him. God is Swasamvedya. He knows by
Himself.

Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are the three aspects of God. Brahma is the creative aspect;
Vishnu is the preservative aspect; and Siva is the destructive aspect. There are three other aspects:
Virat is the manifested aspect; Hiranyagarbha is the immanent aspect; and Ishwara is the causal
aspect. Virat is the sum total of all physical bodies; Hiranyagarbha is the sum total of all minds, i.e.,
He is the Cosmic Mind; and Ishwara is the sum total of all causal bodies (Karana Sareera).

Srishti (creation), Sthiti (preservation), Samhara (destruction), Tirodhana or Tirobhava

(veiling), and Anugraha (grace) are the five kinds of activities of God.

God is the exquisite taste in (cid:145)vimto.(cid:146) He is the sweetness in the words of a child. He is the
strength in a wrestler. He is beauty in the Himalayan landscape. He is thrilling melody in music. He
is the fragrance in jasmine and Champaka. He is the softness in the cushion. He is the Prana in the
body and intelligence in Antahkarana (fourfold mind: mind, intellect, ego and the subconscious
mind).

Earth denotes His all-supporting nature. Water proclaims the message of His purity and
sanctity. Fire indicates His self-luminous nature. Air signifies His omnipotence. Ether speaks of
His all-pervading nature.

He has the six attributes of divine wisdom (Jnana), dispassion (Vairagya), powers
(Aishwarya), strength (Bala), wealth (Sri) and fame (Kirti). 14ence He is called Bhagavan. He is the
wire-puller (Sutradhara) of all these physical bodies of beings. He is the Inner Ruler (Antaryamin)
of all beings. He is in you and you are in Him. He is quite close to you. You were thinking in the

II

7

GOD EXISTS

beginning that He could be found only in Mount Kailas, Rameshwaram, Mecca, Jerusalem, sky or
Heaven. You had very vague ideas. This body is His moving temple. The sanctum sanctorum is the
chamber of your own heart. Close your eyes. Withdraw your senses from the sensual objects.
Search Him there with one-pointed mind, devotion and pure love. You will surely find Him. He is
waiting there with outstretched arms to embrace you. If you cannot find Him there, you cannot find
Him anywhere else.

God-realisation alone can put an end to the Samsaric wheel of birth and death with its
concomitant evils such as birth, disease, death, sorrow, pain, etc. Eternal happiness can be had only
in God. That is the reason why sages and saints, scriptures and Srutis make a very emphatic
statement and lay great stress on the importance and necessity of God-realisation. Bhakti or
devotion can help one in the attainment of God-realisation. So cultivate Bhakti, come face to face
with God, and taste the nectar of God-consciousness which alone is the summum bonum of human
life and human endeavour. Purify the heart. Control the senses. Sing His Name. Feel His Presence
everywhere. Repeat His Mantra. Meditate on His Form. realise Him. Rejoice in Him. Attain peace,
bliss and immortality.

CAN GOD BE SEEN ?

Emperor Akbar once asked his wise Minister Birbal, (cid:147)Well, Birbal, you often repeat God is
everywhere.(cid:148) Birbal rejoined, (cid:147)Yes, Badshah! God is everywhere. There is absolutely no doubt in
this.(cid:148) Akbar pulled the diamond ring off his finger and asked Birbal, (cid:147)Is your God in this ring, too?(cid:148)
Birbal replied, (cid:147)Yes, Badshah! He is certainly in the ring.(cid:148) (cid:147)Then can you make me see Him?(cid:148)
asked the Emperor. Birbal had no answer to this. He asked for time; the Emperor allowed him six
months in which to find an answer or to find out a way to show Akbar God in the ring.

Birbal went home; he was puzzled. He knew there was a solution to the problem; but he
knew not that solution. He dared not face the Emperor again without an answer to his question. He
grew pale and anxious.

Shortly after this encounter with the Emperor, a little boy-mendicant came to Birbal(cid:146)s house
for alms. He asked Birbal, (cid:147)What ails you, Sir? Why do you look so sordid and miserable? You are a
wise man, and wise men should have no reason for misery! Joy and tranquillity are the marked
characteristics of a wise man.(cid:148) (cid:147)True!(cid:148) replied Birbal: (cid:147)The heart is convinced, but the intellect
cannot frame words for it.(cid:148) Birbal then narrated all that transpired between him and the Emperor.

(cid:147)Is this what you are worrying about?(cid:148) exclaimed the boy in amazement. (cid:147)I can give you the
answer in a moment; but will you allow me to talk to the Emperor personally?(cid:148) Birbal replied in
affirmative and took the boy to the imperial court and addressed the Emperor, (cid:147)My Lord! Even this
little boy can give you the answer to your question.(cid:148)

8

CAN GOD BE SEEN ?

Akbar inwardly appreciated the pluck and boldness of the boy and was curious to hear him.
He asked the boy, (cid:147)If God is all-pervading, son, can you show me your God in the ring?(cid:148) (cid:147)O King!(cid:148)
replied the boy, (cid:147)I can do so in a second; but I am thirsty; I can answer the question after I have taken
a glass of curd.(cid:148) The Emperor at once had a glassful of curd given to him. The boy began to stir the
curd and said, (cid:147)O Emperor, I am used to drinking good curd which has butter in it. I do not like this
stuff which your bearer has brought and which does not yield butter at all.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Certainly, this curd is the best available,(cid:148) replied the Emperor. (cid:147)Remember, little one, that
you are partaking of the product of the Emperor(cid:146)s personal diary.(cid:148) The boy said, (cid:147)Very well! If your
Majesty is so sure that this cup of curd contains butter in it, please show me the butter.(cid:148) The
Emperor laughed aloud and said, (cid:147)I thought so! O ignorant child! You do not know that butter can
be got out of curd only after churning it; and yet you have the audacity to come here and show me
God!(cid:148)

(cid:147)I am not a fool, Badshah Sahib,(cid:148) replied the boy quickly: (cid:147)I only gave you the answer to
your own question!(cid:148) The Emperor was puzzled. The boy said to him, (cid:147)Your Majesty! In exactly the
same manner the Lord is residing within everything. He is the indwelling Presence, the Self of all,
the Light of all lights, the Power that maintains the universe. Yet one cannot see Him with one(cid:146)s
physical eyes. A vision is only a projection of one(cid:146)s own mind before the eye of the mind. One can
realise God intuitively and see Him with the eye of wisdom; but before that one has to churn the five
sheaths, and the objects, and separate the butter, the Reality, from the, curd, the names and forms.(cid:148)

The young boy had thus answered Akbar(cid:146)s question and the Emperor was greatly
impressed. He wanted to know more and asked, (cid:147)Child! Now tell me, what is your God doing all the
while?(cid:148) The mendicant-boy replied: (cid:147)Well, your Majesty, it is God who lends power to our senses,
perception to our mind, discernment to our intellect, strength to our limbs; it is through His will that
we live and die. But man vainly imagines that he is the actor and the enjoyer. Man is a mere nothing
before the Almighty governing Power that directs the movement in the universe.

(cid:147)It is in a twinkling of an eye, when compared to the unimaginable age of the universe, that
empires rise and fall, dynasties rise and perish, the boundaries of the land and the sea wax and wane,
and we find a mountain range where there had been a sea and a new sea where there had been a
plateau. It is in a twinkling of an eye that we find millionaires become paupers and paupers become
millionaires, and a King becomes a wandering exile by a tryst of destiny and a vagrant becomes a
King. So many planets are created, sustained and dissolved every moment in this vast universe.
Who is behind this gigantic phenomena? It is God and none but the one God, to realise whom one
has to give up vanity, the feeling of doership, arrogance and pride; to realise Him one has to
surrender oneself entirely to His will, which can be discerned through cultivation of purity,
emotional maturity and intellectual conviction; to realise that God one has to efface oneself in toto
and feel that one is a mere instrument of His will.(cid:148)

It was a new experience for Emperor Akbar to hear the ancient wisdom from so young a
mendicant. Akbar was very liberal in his views, and this encounter with a Hindu child-monk was
perhaps in a way partly responsible for the Emperor to invite to his court many Hindu scholars and
holy men to participate in spiritual and academic deliberations with Muslim divines and Maulavis.

ARGUMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

1. The existence of Brahman is known on the ground of its being the Self of everyone. For
everyone is conscious of the existence of his Self and never thinks (cid:147)I am not.(cid:148) If, the existence of the
Self were not known, everyone would think (cid:147)I am not.(cid:148) And this Self of whose existence all are
conscious is Brahman or God. It is difficult to define Brahman. But we will have to give a
provisional definition. That is Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss Absolute).

2. Close your eyes and imagine for a moment that you are dead. You can never do so. You
can never think that you will not exist (after death). You will imagine that your dead body is lying
down and that you are witnessing the dead body. This clearly proves that you are always the
witnessing subject (Sakshi, Drashta). There is an inherent feeling in everybody (cid:145)I exist,(cid:146) (cid:145)Aham
Asmi.(cid:146)

3. Because the Self is the basis of the action of proving, it is evident before the action of
proving, and since it is of this character, it is therefore impossible to deny it. In denying Brahman
you deny your own existence which is logically absurd. Brahman is the basis of all presuppositions,
demonstrations and all notions.

4. Every effect has a cause. This phenomenal world must therefore have a cause. It is an
effect of Brahman, the original causeless cause (Parama Karanam). This is the cosmological way of
proving.

5. You cannot think of a finite thing without thinking of something beyond. The mind is so
framed that it cannot think of a finite object without thinking of Infinity. You cannot think of an
effect without thinking of its cause. You cannot think of impurity, duality, disagreement, variety,
mortality, etc., without thinking of purity, oneness, agreement, unity, immortality, etc. The
possibility of the relative implies the reality of the Absolute. This is the psychological method of
proving the existence of Brahman. Infinity belongs to the very essence of His Nature.
Sat-Chit-Ananda is His very essence just as heat and light constitute the very essence of fire.

The (cid:147)I(cid:148) Principle

6. When you are in the darkness, when you are behind a veil, if anybody asks (cid:147)who is
there?(cid:148) you will naturally answer (cid:147)It is I.(cid:148) Then after a second thought, after a moment, you will say
(cid:147)I am Mr. So and So.(cid:148) This (cid:147)I am Mr. So and So(cid:148) is a mental Kalpana (imagination), is Adhyasa or
false superimposition on account of Avidya (ignorance). At first you have expressed spontaneously
your inherent feeling of existence, the big Infinite (cid:147)I.(cid:148) Nothing can resist this innate feeling of
(cid:147)Aham Brahmasmi.(cid:148)

7. Unless there exists one continuous principle equally connected with the past, the present,
and the future or an absolutely unchangeable Self which cognizes everything, we are unable to
account for remembrance, recognition and so on, which are subject to mental impressions on place,

10

ARGUMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

time and cause. The Self is distinct from and superior to ideas, because the ideas require an ultimate
principle which unites and connects them, while the Self is itself the ultimate principle which
renders the cognition of the ideas possible.

8. (cid:147)Aham(cid:148) means (cid:147)I(cid:148) in Sanskrit. (cid:147)Idam(cid:148) means (cid:147)this.(cid:148) When I refer to myself, I speak
(cid:147)Aham(cid:148) and when I refer to you, I say (cid:147)Idam.(cid:148) When you talk to me words are reversed. My (cid:147)Idam(cid:148)
becomes (cid:147)Aham(cid:148) and my (cid:147)Aham(cid:148) becomes (cid:147)Idam(cid:148) for you. Tables are turned over. There is only
(cid:147)Aham(cid:148) everywhere, the one common consciousness. (cid:147)Idam(cid:148) is a mental creation, or false
attribution or Adhyaropa (superimposition) just as a snake is superimposed on a rope. The snake is a
Vivarta (illusory form) of the rope. (cid:147)Idam(cid:148) is a Vivarta of (cid:147)Aham.(cid:148)

Changeless Substance

9. To break through the circle of cause and effect in this phenomenal world we must look for
an existence which does not change (Nirvikara, Kutastha, Nirvikalpa, Achyuta, Avyaya) or depend
upon another (Swatantra) and is always the same and likewise the cause or causeless cause (Parama
Karan) of these changeable existences. This unchanging, independent, beginningless entity (Anadi
Vastu) must be something which cannot be perceived by any sense (Atindriya, Adrishya) and must
be without the attributes found in objects which are perceptible (Nirguna). Here every change
ceases; here the mind can rest; here that faith may find root which we seek in vain among the
fleeting things of the world.

10. There are first our senses; but they have relation to something else; they know nothing
by themselves, and above all, they depend even for their knowledge upon the mind for the latter is
an indispensable medium of perception. Is the mind then a final cause? Far from it, for mind is also
finite and shows its dependence upon something else by the fact, that in deep sleep the mind itself is
without manifestation. Our human knowledge, therefore, limited as it is, has but reference to a
knowledge which is infinite. Having arrived at this conclusion if we again reflect on our own
nature, we find within us a permanent element to which all the modifications of knowledge refer.

It is the Self that hears, sees, minds and knows which does not disappear with the different
acts of knowledge, which is unaltered in all those acts, and without which they were themselves
impossible. It is in one word, our Self, the Soul of souls which, as such, is mere knowledge in the
abstract, free from any limits, and independent of the objects of knowledge. It is the Light of lights,
Life of all lives, Mind of all minds, and Self of all selves. It is the hidden Life, vibrant in every atom.
It is the hidden Light that shines in every creature. It is the hidden Love that embraces all in oneness.
It is the Silent Witness (Sakshi) of all activities in all minds. It is the Brahman of the Upanishads.

Not This, Not This

11. Carefully analyze this little (cid:147)I,(cid:148) the lower self-arrogating, false personality which is the

cause for all miseries, troubles and tribulations.

The physical body is not the (cid:147)I.(cid:148) Even if the leg or hand is amputated still the (cid:147)I(cid:148) remains. It
is made up of five elements. It is the resultant product of (cid:147)Annam(cid:148) or food. Hence it is styled as

11

GOD EXISTS

(cid:147)Annamaya Kosha.(cid:148) It is full of parts. It has a beginning and an end. It is Vinashi or perishable. It is
Jada or non-sentient or non-intelligent.

The sense is not the (cid:147)I.(cid:148) It is inert. It has a beginning and an end. It is the effect of Rajo Guna

and Sattwa Guna. It is made up of Tanmatras (root elements of matter).

Mind is not the (cid:147)I.(cid:148) There is no mind in sleep. Yet there is the feeling of continuity of
consciousness. Mind is Jada (insentient). It has a beginning and an end. It is a bundle of changing
ideas. It gropes in darkness. It sinks down in grief. It becomes like a block of wood in extreme fear.

Prana also is not the (cid:147)I.(cid:148) It is an effect of Rajo Guna. It is insentient. It has a beginning and

an end. You can suspend the breath and yet the continuity of consciousness remains.

The causal bodies which constitutes the Moola Ajnana (root of ignorance), and which is

made up of subtle impressions is not the little (cid:147)I.(cid:148) It is insentient. It has a beginning and an end.

When I say (cid:147)I(cid:148) I really feel (cid:147)I am(cid:148) or (cid:147)I exist,(cid:148) (Sat aspect). I understand or comprehend that
(cid:147)I am(cid:148) (Chit aspect). (cid:147)I feel blissful(cid:148) (Ananda aspect). On careful analysis by introspection this
little (cid:147)I(cid:148) dwindles into an airy nothing just as an onion is reduced to nothing when the different
layers are peeled off. But we get at the core or essence the big Infinite (cid:147)I,(cid:148) Sat-Chit-Ananda
Brahman, the substratum or background for all these appearances, many little (cid:147)I(cid:148)s.

Reality Behind Appearance

12. You see a mango tree in front of you. It has a name. It has a form. It consists of stem,
branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits, etc. These two aspects or parts of it are only visible to the
ordinary sight, to the ordinary run of mankind. They are wholly occupied and charmed by these two
aspects or parts only (Nama-Rupa). They are unconscious of the truth that lies at the back of the
mango tree.

In addition to these two aspects there are three other aspects or parts of it. The mango tree
(cid:147)is,(cid:148) that is, it exists. This is its existence aspect (Sat). It (cid:147)shines.(cid:148) You understand that a mango tree
stands before you. It is cognized by your senses and mind. This is its consciousness aspect (Chit).
The presence of the tree gives you delight. This is the bliss aspect (Ananda). Now cut down the tree
and make it into planks. Even then there is Sat-Chit-Ananda in this plank. The plank (cid:147)is(cid:148) or exists. It
(cid:147)shines.(cid:148) You know it. It gives you delight. You can make it into chairs, benches, etc. Now put the
plank into fire. It is rendered into ashes. Even then there is Sat-Chit-Ananda in the ash. The ash (cid:147)is(cid:148)
or exists. The ash (cid:147)shines.(cid:148) You know it. It gives you delight. It is used for various purposes. So you
see that the names and forms may change, but the Sat-Chit-Ananda remains for ever. That is the
Truth.

Every form has its own Sat-Chit-Ananda. The form is different (Vyatireka), but the essence

that is at the back is the same in all forms (Anvaya).

12

ARGUMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

Self Alone Is Dear

13. You love your wife and children in and through the Atma (or Brahman) that is hidden
inside the body. If you had really loved the physical body alone, you ought to love the dead body
also that is in a cadaveric, rigid state with ensuing decomposition. But on the contrary you try to get
rid of dead body as soon as possible.

14. When the house is on fire you try to save yourself first and ignore the property, wife, and
others. This clearly shows that you love to a very high degree something which is hidden within
your physical body. That something is dearer to you than anything else in the world. That
something is Atma or Brahman or Self of everyone, the one common consciousness, the
Adhishthana or substratum for all, for everything, for the whole world.

15. There are five Indriyas (organs that grasp) and five Vishayas (objects). Eye can see
forms. Forms are made up of Agni-tattwa (fire principle). Eyes are also formed out of fire
Tanmatra. So there is a relationship between eye and form. Eyes cannot hear sounds. Ear is made up
of Shabda-tanmatra (sound element). Sound emanates from Akasa (ether). There is a relationship
between ear and sound. Ear cannot see. All the five senses are insentient or non-intelligent. They
borrow their light and power from Atma or pure Spirit which is at the back of these senses just as a
cup of water, when exposed to the sun, borrows the heat from the sun.

Atma in conjunction with eye Indriya and objects gives rise to perception of the world. The
whole world is nothing but Atma or Brahman. Atma only can see Atma. Atma sees Atma. There can
be relationship between Atman inside and Atman outside. A piece of stone is only Atman or
Brahman. Brahman appears as stone through mind and physical lens. In Reality the whole world is
nothing but Brahman (Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma). There cannot be any connection between
Atma and Anatma (Self and non-Self).

16. In sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind apparent and yet you experience peace
and bliss. When there are no objects, wherefrom have you derived the bliss? The mind rests in
Brahman during sleep and it is from Brahman this bliss is derived. Further during sleep when there
are no other persons (cid:147)I(cid:148) alone exists.

Provisional Definitions

17. Cogito ergo sum(cid:151)(cid:148)I think, therefore I am.(cid:148) This is Descarte(cid:146)s fundamental basis of
philosophy. This is in accordance with Sri Sankara(cid:146)s statement that the Atman cannot be illusive,
for he who would deny it, even in denying it witnesses its reality.

18. Through Brahman in its true nature is indefinable (Anirdeshya) and unknowable
(Agrahya), still we have to give some provisional definitions. Advaitins mention some attributes
(Viseshanas) or characteristics (Lakshanas) to mark off from Brahman objects possessing other
attributes, and thus help us to concentrate on the subject in question. These characteristics are either
essential
as
omnipotence, omniscience, creatorship, etc. Western philosophers admit that there is a great

as Sat-Chit-Ananda or

(Svarupalakshanas)

accidental

thought or intelligence behind the universe. The second and third aphorisms of Vedanta Sutras
denote the omniscience of the Lord.

19. Karma is Jada (non-intelligent). There must be a dispenser to allot the fruits for the
actions of Jivas. The Karma theory only can wisely explain the variegated nature of the world (poor,
rich, healthy, sickly persons, mighty intellectual giants, born idiots, infirm persons, born deaf and
dumb persons, etc.). An overseer of works knows how much wages are to be given to various
workers in the contract work according to the ability and nature of work turned out by the workers.
Even so the Lord of the Universe knows the actions and motives of the Jivas and allots accordingly
fruits for their actions.

20. Many a time you propose many things but God disposes otherwise. Everyone has
practical experience of this daily. This clearly indicates that there is a Supreme Power who controls
and guides every human being. You get exaltation and satisfaction when you do virtuous actions.
You get alarmed and frightened when you do vicious actions. Why are you afraid? This indicates
that
there is a supreme Self behind your conscience who witnesses all your actions
(Karmadhyaksha) and the activities of the mind also.

Inner Ruler And Controller

21. Om kena ishitam patati preshitam manah? (cid:147)By whom is the mind directed?(cid:148) (Kena

Upanishad, Mantra 1)

The Manas (mind) is an organ of sensation and thought. It must be under the control of some
one who uses this instrument. The Jiva or human soul is not the director of the mind because we see
that ordinary men are swayed away ruthlessly by the mind. Therefore there must exist some other
Supreme Being, who is the director of the mind. He is the Antaryamin, the Inner Ruler and
Controller.

22. Mind is a powerful engine. There must be a very intelligent driver for this engine. That

driver is Brahman.

23. There is another way of proving the existence of Atma or Brahman. The eye is the Drik
(perceiver); the object is the perceived (Drishya). The mind is the perceiver and the eye is the
perceived. Atma is the perceiver and the mind with its modifications is the perceived. If a perceiver
of the Atma is sought, the enquiry will end in what is known as a regressus ad infinitum (Anavastha
Dosha). Therefore the Atma (witness of everything and of all minds) is self-existent, self-created,
self-luminous, independent, immortal, unchanging, beyond time, space and causation. It is not seen
by anything else. The objects are different but the perceiving eye is one. The Indriyas (senses) are
different but the perceiving mind is one. Minds are different but the perceiving Atma is one. You
find one behind many. Vichara (enquiry) is needed.

24. Brahman is not void. It is not blankness or emptiness. It is impossible for the mind to
conceive of an absolute nothing. It is Paripoorna (full) because all desires melt there. You get
supreme, eternal satisfaction (Parama Nitya Tripti). It is everything. When you become nothing by

14

ARGUMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

annihilating this false illusory (cid:147)I(cid:148) you get everything. You become everything (Paramam-apnoti;
Brahma-eva-bhavati).

Have Faith In God

25. Faith in the laws of nature is faith in God. The whole world runs under definite,
well-established laws. There is no such thing as chance or accident. God or Ishwara is
Tatastha-lakshana (accidental attribute) of Brahman only. For the sake of pious worship of Bhaktas,
the Nirguna (without attributes) Brahman simply appears as Saguna (with attributes) Brahman. In
reality there is no such thing as Saguna Brahman. There is existence only. That is Reality. That is
Truth.

26. Just as you see a tree in front of you, there must be somebody to see the activities of the
mind. Otherwise (cid:147)Kartru-Kartavya Bhava Sambandha Virodha(cid:148)(a feeling of contradiction in the
relationship between the performer and the performance) will come. That somebody is Kutastha
Brahman (deep-seated Reality).

27. The simplest comparison of two ideas and the recognition of them as like or unlike
presupposes the indivisible unity of that which compares them, an Atma external to the content with
which it deals.

28. The relief that is obtained by remembrance of God in adversity indicates that there is a

supreme Power who guides and controls human beings.

29. Even a rank materialist and an atheist cries out for help (cid:147)O God! forgive me, protect
me,(cid:148) when he comes face to face with a tiger in a thick forest, when he is in great distress, when he is
in a helpless condition, while the steamer in which he travels is in a sinking condition, when he
suffers from paralysis, when there is an earthquake or volcanic eruption, when he is left alone at
dead of night amidst thunder and lightning.

30. An atheist says that there is no God. But that knower who knows the non-existence of

God is Brahman.

Sunya is Brahman (God).

31. A Sunyavadin says that there is only Sunya (void). But that knower who knows the

Real Source Of Happiness

32. A desire arises in the mind. There is a Vritti (impression) now. This Vritti agitates your
mind till you get satisfaction through enjoyment of the desired object. There is Shanti or peace or
happiness after the enjoyment is over. Another desire arises. Now in the interval between the
gratification of one desire and the manifestation of another desire there is pure bliss, because there
is no mind then. It is at rest. You are in union with Brahman. That state of pure bliss between two
desires is Brahman. If you can prolong that period of bliss through Sadhana by keeping up the idea
of Brahman and by not allowing any other Vritti or desire to crop up, you will be in Samadhi

15

GOD EXISTS

(superconscious state). The period between one Vritti and another Vritti is the real Sandhi
(juncture).

33. Who sees the defects in the Sun(cid:151)whether it shines brightly or whether it is obscured by
clouds? It is the eye. Who sees the defects in the eye whether there is cataract or not? It is the Buddhi
(intellect). Who sees the defects in the Buddhi whether there is confusion or clarity? Who
illuminates the Buddhi? It is Aham (infinite (cid:147)I(cid:148)). This (cid:147)Aham(cid:148) is Kutastha or Atma or Brahman,
illuminator of everything.

34. Who illuminates the objects in the dream? It is Brahman. There is no other light there.

35. Suppose there is a big light at night. You stand at a distance. Something stands between
you and the light as an obstruction and you cannot see the light. But you can see the objects clearly
that are illuminated by the light. Though you cannot see the light directly, you clearly conclude that
there must be a big light, through the perception of objects. Even so you see the world with its
variegated coloured objects. There must be an illuminator behind this nature. That illuminator, the
(cid:147)Light of all Lights, Jyotishamapi tat jyoti of the Gita, is Brahman, the Adhisthana (support) for this
illusory world.

36. When the mind runs from one object to another object, the state in the interval wherein

there is no mind is Swarupa Sthiti (the natural state). That is Brahman.

Appearance Adumbrates Reality

37. The very idea of creation suggests that there must be a creator; the idea of matter
suggests that there must be a Spirit. The very idea of changing phenomena suggests there must be an
unchanging noumenon. The very idea of a changing mind suggests that there must be an
unchanging Sakshi (witness) and controller (Niyamaka) for the mind.

38. There is perfect law, order, and harmony in the universe. There must be a controller for

this universe who must be omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent.

39. At night in utter darkness you say (cid:147)there is nobody there.(cid:148) How do you know this? You

know because in reality you are the Sakshi (witness). That Sakshi is Brahman.

40. You say in daily life (cid:147)My body,(cid:148) (cid:147)My Prana,(cid:148) (cid:147)My mind,(cid:148) (cid:147)My Indriya.(cid:148) This clearly
denotes that the Self or Atma is entirely different from body, mind, Prana and Indriyas. Mind and
body are your servants or instruments. They are as much outside of you as these towels, chairs,
cups, are. You are holding the body just as you hold a long walking stick in your hand.

41. As a punishment for a certain crime you would rather prefer to have your hands cut off
than the eyes removed. This indicates obviously that the Indriya is closer to you and dearer also than
the external instruments. Instead of sentence for death you would rather prefer to have your two
eyes removed. This shows that life is dearer and closer to you than the Indriya. When you suffer
from a serious, protracted ailment, you wish to give up your life also, to get happiness. This shows
that the Self or Atma is dearer than life or Prana.

16

ARGUMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

Continuity Of Existence

42. There are two powerful instincts in men and animals. They are self-preservative and
reproductive instincts. Hunger is a manifestation of the self-preservative instinct. The basis for the
self-preservative instinct is the immortal nature of the soul. Owing to Bhranti (illusion), the Jiva or
individual soul thinks that the body is Atma and eternal and the self-preservative instinct tries its
level best to preserve the body for a long time (Abhinivesha) and perpetuate the body here. The idea
of immortality is wrongly transferred to the body owing to illusion. Though there is death for the
physical body,
live for ever here. The existence of the
self-preservative instinct gives the clue to the existence of an Immortal Brahman (God).

the Jiva imagines that he will

43. The law of reincarnation is infallible. The soul of a man which survived after death in the
previous life remembers, in the next life also through the force of memory (Samskara), of its
existence even after its separation from the physical body. So there is an inherent feeling in men that
they exist even after the death of the physical body. Existence is Brahman.

44. Man generally argues at the time of his death, (cid:147)I have undergone many miseries,
troubles and difficulties in this life. I have done various good acts. They may not go in vain. After
all, is it for this one life alone I have laboured so much? This cannot be. I must be immortal.(cid:148) He
invents the theory of Immortality. Even commonsense will tell everybody that there must be an
immortal Atma.

45. You had been a child playing in your mother(cid:146)s lap. Then you grew up into a
school-going boy. Then you became a sighing lover in adolescence. Then you reached adult
manhood. Lastly you became a veteran with grey hairs. You have had a variety of experiences.
There must be an unchanging Self as a Sakshi to witness these changing experiences. Otherwise
these experiences are impossible. That unchanging Self is Brahman. It is the substratum for all
these changing experiences of life. An invariable Self must link continuously the varying
childhood, boyhood, manhood and old age.

46. When you search a thing in the dark in a room at night it is through the Prakasha
(illumination) of Adhishtana-Chaitanya or Brahma-Chaitanya that you get at the thing by stretching
the hands here and there in the room even in the absence of any kind of light. Brahman is
self-luminous and Sarvaprakasha (illuminates everything). It illuminates the Buddhi, eye, sun and
all objects.

MYSTERIOUS BODY AND LIFE PRINCIPLE

Salutations to the Lord who is the Creator of this body and life, who is life itself, who is the
indweller and ruler of this body and life, who is the source for the life, mind and this world, who is
Satchidananda, and who is the protector of all beings.

The Lord Himself has assumed the forms of body, mind Prana or life, organs, cells, tissues,
muscles, nerves, etc., through His illusory power, Maya, which is also known by the name Prakriti
or Nature.

The body is the mysterious palace of the Lord. This is His nine-gated city or Navadwarapuri
or Puriashtaka (city with eight groups). It is the most wonderful mechanism in the world. The
driving force of this body is the Lord because He gives force to the vital force itself. This body is the
moving temple of God.

It is a mysterious boat to cross this Samsara or the ocean of births and deaths. It was with this
boat that Sri Sankara, Sri Dattatreya, Lord Jesus, Lord Buddha and several others crossed this
formidable ocean of Samsara.

A spermatozoon, which is a millionth part of a drop of semen, and an ovum from the ovary
joined together give rise to the formation of this body. What a great mystery! That subtle power
which is the source for this semen and ovarian product, that subtle essence which sustains all these,
is thy own Self. That is Truth. That is Soul. Thou art That. realise this and free yourself from the
cage of bone and flesh.

The growth of the body with several limbs, organs, etc., from a tiny peck of semen, bespeaks
the omnipotence of the Lord. You will be struck with awe and wonder when you begin to think
seriously of the origin of this body.

In the embryonic stage when the child dwells in the womb of the mother there is no
difference between a male and a female child up to a certain stage. Both the male and female genital
organs are developed from the same Wolffian body which contains the female (ovarian) as well as
the male (testicular) tissue. By some unknown process of growth one of the tissues preponderates
and the distinguishing characteristics of sex are developed by about the third month. The testicles
are in the abdomen of the male child. They descend into the scrotal bag by about the seventh month.
What a great wonder! The Lord only, who is the source of all beings and the ruler of all creatures,
knows Himself by Himself.

This world is (cid:147)Manomatram Jagat(cid:148) or (cid:147)Manah Kalpitam Jagat.(cid:148) Only the mind has created
this world. In reality there is neither world nor body nor sex. The sex affair is a mere idea. It is mere
imagination. Male may become female and female may become male. Can a real entity change its
form? If testosterone or male hormone is injected in a female, she develops male characteristics.
Similarly, when testes substance is grafted on in a female, whose ovaries are removed,

18

MYSTERIOUS BODY AND LIFE PRINCIPLE

masculination takes place. Conversely, the administration of estrogen or female hormones to
males, especially the castrates in whom the testes are removed, may produce feminization.

The partial feminine characteristics in a man are attributed to the persistence of ovarian
tissue in him and the partial masculine characteristics in a woman are ascribed to the persistence of
testicular tissue in her.

What is all this? Does this not prove that this world is illusory? How can a changing thing be

the ultimate Reality?

This body is made up of countless cells. The cell contains protoplasm, nucleus and other
inclusions. This was found out only after the invention of the microscope by about 1730 by
Leuwenhoek, a Dutchman. The magnifying power of the lens was something like 300 to 500
diameters in the beginning. He was able to see some comparatively big germs. With the use of the
microscope the cell-theory was formulated by Schwan in 1739. Now there is tremendous
magnification by means of suitable lenses. You can see the minutest microbe.

The house is made of pillars, walls, fittings, etc., covered by protective paints. Similarly,
this body-house is built up by bones, muscles, fat, etc., which are ultimately made up by
aggregations of various types of cells. The bones represent the stones and bricks, the muscles and
connective tissues the lime, and the skin the cement.

All the physiologists say that they have no knowledge of how living things first come into
existence. Starling, an eminent physiologist, says: (cid:147)Life is indefinable for biological science, as
time and space are indefinable for the physical sciences. By this is meant that we cannot even
approximately define life without the idea itself being explicit in our definition. Our business is,
given living things, to study their phenomena.(cid:148)

Claude Bernard, who is regarded as the father of physiology says: (cid:147)Vital force directs
phenomena which it does not produce; physical agencies produce in living things phenomena
which they do not direct.(cid:148)

Vital force is Prana. It controls and governs the different systems of the body. This vital

force itself derives its power from the Lord or the Indweller or the Inner Ruler.

The physiologists say: (cid:147)We know only how urea is formed from the amino acids. We know
the gross processes that are involved in its formation and the formation of saliva, semen, etc. from
blood, but the actual formation by the living cells and the exact mechanism are still in the realm of
speculation only.(cid:148) They will know this only when they realise the Lord who gives force to the vital
power or life and intelligence to the cells.

NATURE OF REALITY

That something by possessing which there is nothing more advantageous to be possessed,
whose bliss is greater than the bliss obtained by any other source, by knowing which there is no
greater knowledge to be attained, should be understood as Brahman.

That something, after seeing which there is nothing more to be seen, after becoming which
there is nothing more to become, after knowing which there remains nothing to be known, should
be understood as Brahman.

That something which is all-pervading, around, above, below, which is Satchidananda
(existence, knowledge and bliss), which is without a second, endless, eternal, one and one alone,
should be understood as Brahman.

The everlasting, the one continuous experience-whole, which is attained by sublating what

is not it, that should be regarded as Brahman.

Brahma and others who depend on that Brahman who is second to none, enjoy happiness

proportionately by getting a very small amount of His supreme happiness.

All objects are united with That. All actions are united with Consciousness. Therefore

Brahman pervades everything, just as butter is in every particle of milk.

That which is neither subtle nor gross, neither short nor long, which is unborn, unchanging,

destitute of form, quality, caste and name, that should be understood as Brahman.

By whose light, the sun, etc., shine, but which is not illumined by these, and by whose light

all these objects shine, that should be understood as Brahman.

Like fire in a red-hot iron ball, Brahman, pervading the whole world, both internally and

externally, illumines it; and without being illumined by anything else, shines by its own light.

Brahman is different from the world, yet there is nothing which is not Brahman. If anything

other than Brahman is seen, it is as illusory as (cid:147)water in the mirage.(cid:148)

Whatever is seen or heard is no other than Brahman. Through Tattva-Jnana, this world is

seen to be Satchidananda, the secondless Brahman.

He who has the eye of Wisdom sees Satchidananda Brahman in all things, but he who has

not the eye of Knowledge cannot see it, just as a blind man cannot see the brilliant sun.

20

NATURE OF REALITY

The Jiva (individual soul) melted in the fire of Jnana, kindled by Sravana, etc., is cleansed of

all impurities and shines by himself like burnt gold.

The Atman is the sun of knowledge that rises in the Akasa of the heart, destroys the darkness

of ignorance, permeates and supports all, shines and makes everything shine.

That actionless Paramahamsa who has given up the limitations of direction, place, time,
etc., who worships and attains the Atma which is all-pervading, eternal, blissful, spotless, becomes
all-knowing, all-pervading and immortal.

1. Brahman is attributeless without any limiting adjunct, independent, ever free and all-full.

2. Brahman is distinct from the three bodies and the five sheaths. He is the silent witness of
the three states. He transcends the three Gunas and the pairs of the opposites. He is an embodiment
of Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence-Knowledge-Bliss). He is the essence. He is the source or womb for
the mind, Indriyas, body and this world.

3. Brahman is Ananda-Swaroopa (nature of bliss). He is Anandamaya (made up of great
happiness). He is Ananda-Ghana (full of pure joy). He is Ananda-Murti (idol of happiness). He is
Ananda-Vigraha (bliss personified). He is Ananda-Sagara (ocean of happiness). He is
Niratisayananda (nothing can exceed this joy). He is Parama-Ananda (supreme bliss). He is
Ananta-Sukha (infinite happiness). He is Nitya-Sukha (eternal bliss). He is Akhanda-Sukha
(complete joy).

4. Brahman is within and without. He is above and below. He is in front and behind. He is in
all sides. He is everywhere, like the all-pervading ether. He is Chidakasa. The five attributes:
Existence (Sat), Consciousness (Chit), Bliss (Ananda), Eternal (Nitya), and Fullness (Paripoorna),
express Brahman in the best possible manner. Meditate on these and realise Him.

5. Behind this world show, behind this physical phenomena, behind these names and forms,
behind the feelings, thoughts, emotions, sentiments, there dwells the silent witness, thy immortal
Friend and real Well-wisher,
the invisible Power or
Consciousness.

the Purusha or the World-teacher,

6. Just as one thread penetrates all flowers in a garland, so also one Self penetrates all these
living beings. He is hidden in all beings and forms, like oil in seed, butter in milk, mind in brain,
Prana in the body, fetus in the womb, sun behind the clouds, fire in wood, vapour in the atmosphere,
salt in water, scent in flowers, sound in the gramophone-records, gold in quartz, microbes in blood.

7. Just as the light is the same in bulbs of different colours, even so the bodies and mental

Bhavanas (attitudes) are different, but Atma is one in all beings.

8. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears to be many, so also the Atman

appears to be many when reflected through various minds in various bodies.

II

21

GOD EXISTS

9. Just as fire is the same and only one, though it enters the fuels of various sorts, so also the
Lord of the universe, who has created the world and entered into all beings, appears different
because of the different bodies in which He resides.

10. Just as fire blazes forth when the ash above it is removed, Brahman shines forth when
the veil of ignorance, which conceals It, is removed. Just as butter is perceived when milk is
converted into curd and churned, so also Brahman is perceived through the churning of meditation.
Just as hunger, thirst, pain, taste, etc., have to be experienced, but cannot be seen by the fleshy eyes,
even so Brahman has to be experienced through deep meditation and Samadhi. Just as the tiny
bacilli that produce cholera, typhoid, etc. cannot be seen by the naked eye, but can be seen with the
help of a microscope, so also Brahman cannot be seen by the physical eyes but can be seen through
the eye of intuition.

11. He who sees all, but whom no one beholds, who illumines the intellect, the sun, moon,

stars and the whole universe, but whom they cannot illumine, is Brahman.

12. He sees without eyes, hears without ears, feels without skin, tastes without tongue,
grasps without hand, walks without feet, smells without a nose, knows without a mind, because He
is pure, all-pervading Consciousness.

13. He is formless (Nirakara), without Gunas (Nirguna), without any special characteristics
(Nirvisesha), without parts (Nishkala), without limbs (Niravayava), without action (Nishkriya). He
is eternal (Nitya), pure (Suddha), perfect (Siddha), free (Mukta).

14. Brahman is Truth (Satyam), Wisdom (Jnanam), Infinity (Anantam). He is Peace
(Santam), Auspiciousness (Sivam), One without a second (Advaitam). He is without old age
(Ajaram), immortal (Amritam), fearless (Abhayam), and the Highest (Param). He is the absolute
(Kevala).

15. That place, where all speech stops, all thoughts cease, where the functions of the

intellect and all organs stop, is Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss.

16. Peace, God, Atma, Brahman, Freedom, Immortality, Emancipation are synonymous

terms.

17. God is with form and without form, and He is above forms. He is actionless; He is the

actor also. He is the manifest; He is the unmanifest. He is immanent; He is transcendent.

18. There is a living, unchanging, eternal Consciousness that underlies all names and forms,

and that holds all together. That is God or Brahman.

19. Unseen He helps you with faithful hands. Unheard He hears your speech. Unknown He

knows your thoughts. He is pure, all-pervading Consciousness, Sat-Chit-Ananda.

22

NATURE OF REALITY

20. God(cid:146)s Will expresses itself everywhere as law. The law of gravitation, cohesion,
relativity, cause and effect, the laws of electricity, chemistry, physics, all the psychic laws, are
expressions of God(cid:146)s Will.

21. Brahman alone is real. Individual soul is identical with Brahman. Everything else is

unreal. This is the fundamental tenet of Vedanta philosophy.

22. Brahman is not this; it is not that. The denial of attributes to Brahman does not reduce it
to a void or nonentity. Brahman does not possess any attribute that belongs to Maya. It is an
embodiment of Bliss and Wisdom.

23. Infinity, Eternity, Immortality and Absoluteness are the characteristics of the limitless

Existence-Knowledge-Bliss.

24. The Absolute baffles the mind of even the greatest scholar. It eludes the grasp of even
the mightiest intellect. It is experienced as Pure Consciousness, where intellect dies, scholarship
perishes and the entire being itself is completely lost in it. All is lost, and all is found.

25. God is very close to you. He abides in your heart. Closer is He than breathing, nearer

than hands and feet. He is your very Self or Atma.

HOW TO ATTAIN GOD-REALISATION?

Develop discrimination between the real and the unreal. God alone is real. Everything else
is unreal. Renounce all sensual pleasures, seeing the defects in them. They wear out the senses,
cause diseases, restlessness of mind., etc. Equip yourself with the sixfold virtues (Shadsampat) of
serenity (Sama), control of the senses (Dama), cessation from sensual enjoyments (Uparati),
endurance (Titiksha), faith in God, scriptures, Guru and in one(cid:146)s own self (Sraddha) and
concentration of mind (Samadhana). Hear the Mahavakyas (the great sentences of the Upanishads)
that speak of the identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul. Reflect upon them and then
practise intense meditation. You will attain Self-realisation.

Serve all, seeing God in all. Perform all your daily actions as worship of God. Give up the
idea that you are the doer. Feel that God does everything and that you are only His instrument. Give
up attachment to actions and their fruits.

Do Japa of His Holy Name. His Name is a great purifier. Sing His praises. Worship Him.

Meditate upon His beautiful form. Surrender to His Will (Atmanivedan).

GOD EXISTS

Do not identify yourself with the body, which is inert, impure, perishable and which is only
a combination of the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Always feel that you are the
all-pervading, formless, pure, Satchidananda Atma. Assert (cid:145)Aham Brahmasmi(cid:146). See the Self in all.

Take Sattvic food. Keep company With the wise. Study Gita and other religious books
daily. Eradicate all vices. Cultivate all virtues. Observe Ahimsa (Non-injury), Satyam (Truth), and
Brahmacharya (Chastity).

Keep the body fit and energetic by practising daily some important Asanas, such as
Sirshasana, Sarvangasana, Matsyasana, Paschimottanasana, Bhujangasana and Mayurasana, a few
rounds of easy, comfortable Pranayama and light physical exercise such as long walk.

God is a question of supply and demand. If you really yearn for His Darshan, He will reveal

Himself to you in an instant.

Combine all the love you cherish towards all worldly objects, wife, son, wealth, property,
relatives, friends, and then apply this combined love towards God. You will realise in this very
second.

It is not very difficult to have Darshan (vision) of God, or to please Him. God is an ocean of
mercy. He is a slave of His devotees. He ran with lightning speed to save Draupadi from the wicked
hands of the Kauravas. He begged pardon of Prahlada for not coming to his rescue earlier. He
caressed the dying bird, Jatayu, keeping him on His laps, and wiped off his dirt with the trusses of
His hairs. He carried the palanquin of His devotee Tyagaraja and also water in a vessel for his
ablution. He proudly bears, as an ornament, the scar left on His chest by the kick of Bhrigu. He
wears the skulls of His devotees as a garland round His neck. The Lord Himself has admitted: (cid:147)I am
under the complete control of my Bhaktas.(cid:148)

Pray to Him fervently for His Grace. Be up and doing in spiritual Sadhana, Bhajana, etc.
Never waste a single minute. Pray fervently like Prahlad. Sing His name like Radha. Weep in
solitude like Mira on account of His separation. Do kirtan like Lord Gauranga. Sing Bhajan like
Ram Prasad of Bengal. Dance in Divine ecstasy like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu and enter into Bhava
Samadhi. Repeat His Name like Valmiki, Tukaram and Ramdas. He will certainly bless you with
His beatific vision, Supreme Knowledge, and Eternal Bliss.

MYSTERIOUS HELP FROM THE LORD TO BHAKTAS

MYSTERIOUS HELP FROM THE LORD TO BHAKTAS

Hear the glorious events in the lives of Sri Roopkala Bhagavan of Ayodhya and a
soldier-Bhakta of Punjab. Sri Roopkala Bhagavan was a famous Bhakta who lived the latter part of
his life in Ayodhya. He was a native of Chhapra, near Varanasi. He was an Inspector of Schools. He
was a sincere devotee of Sri Rama. One day he was absorbed in meditation, He did not visit any
school for inspection. Lord Rama Himself assumed the form of the inspector through his
Yoga-Maya Shakti, inspected a particular school, signed in the register, and disappeared. When Sri
Roopkala Bhagavan came to the school next morning, the teachers said that he had already visited
the school the previous day and showed him his signature in the register. He was very much
astonished. This one evidence gave him great encouragement. He instantaneously resigned his
post; went to Ayodhya to spend the rest of his life in communion with Lord Rama.

Have you not heard of an incident in Punjab? A soldier, a sincere Rama Bhakta, was on
patrol duty at night in a cantonment area. One night a fine Kirtan party was moving about nearby.
The soldier was very much moved by their deep devotion. He left his duty and joined the Kirtan
party. He enjoyed the Kirtan to his heart(cid:146)s content. In the depth of higher emotions, he entered into
Bhava Samadhi, the ecstatic state of Bhaktas. When he returned at 6 a.m., with great apprehension
he enquired the Subedar Major whether anything had happened during his absence. The Subedar
Major said, (cid:147).Nothing happened. I saw you throughout on your patrol duty.(cid:148) The Bhakta-soldier
was extremely surprised to hear the statement of the Subedar Major. He thought it was all the Grace
of Rama. Rama Himself took charge of the patrol duty to protect his devotee. He assumed the form
of the soldier. When the Bhakta came to know of this incident, he immediately managed to get
himself demobilized and went to Ayodhya to spend the rest of his life in devotion. If you are sincere
in your devotion, you will have Darshan of God face to face this very moment.

INCIDENTS FROM THE LIFE OF SWAMI SADASIVA

BRAHMENDRA

More than one hundred and fifty years ago there lived a very famous Yogi-Jnani by name
Sadasiva Brahmendra Saraswati in Nerur, near Karuru, in the district of Trichinoploy, South India.
He is the author of Brahma Sutra Vritti and Atma Vidya Vilas and various other books. He has
performed innumerable miracles. Once when he was absorbed in Samadhi on the banks of the
Kaveri he was carried away by the flood and thrown somewhere else. He was deeply buried
underneath the sand. Peasants went to plough the fields. They hit against the head of the Yogi and
some blood oozed out. They dug out and to their great astonishment they found a Yogi seated in
Samadhi.

On another occasion as an Avadhoot he entered the zenana (tent) of a Muslim chief naked.
The chief was quite enraged at the sage. He cut off one of his arms. Sadasiva Brahman walked away
without uttering a word and without showing any sign of pain. The chief was greatly astonished at
this strange condition of the sage. He thought that this man must be a Mahatma, a superhuman
being. He repented much and followed the sage to apologize. Sadasiva did not even know that his
arm was cut off. When the chief narrated to the sage what had happened in the camp, Sadasiva
excused the chief and simply touched his maimed arm. Sadasiva Brahman had a fresh arm.

These incidents in the life of this sage should convince everyone that there is a sublime
divine life independent of objects and the play of the mind and the senses. The sage was quite
unconscious of the world. He did not feel a bit when his arm was cut off. He ought to have been
absorbed in the Divine Consciousness and become one with the Divine. Ordinary people yell out
even when there is a pin prick on their body. The above incidents in the life of Sadasiva Brahman
amply prove the existence of God and a divine, eternal life, where all sorrows melt, all desires are
satisfied and where one gets supreme bliss, peace and knowledge.

A QUESTION OF BELIEF

Rama said, (cid:147)O Swami Sivananda
Give me definite proofs for the existence of God.(cid:148)
Sivananda replied, (cid:147)O Ram!
Your mother said, (cid:145)Krishna is your father.(cid:146)
You did not ask her
(cid:147)O Mother, prove he is my father.(cid:148)
Existence of God is Svatah-Siddha.
It is self-proved.
It is a great insult, it is quite absurd to say.
Give me proofs for the existence of God.
When the Lord is everywhere.
Behold His glory(cid:151)in the sun, moon and stars.
In the fire, in the lightning, thunder,
In the ocean, in the sky, in the flowers,
In the mind, in the intellect and in Prana.

Prof: (cid:147)Yes.(cid:148)

Siva: (cid:147)If you say that you do not exist, and if somebody beats you then you will see whether

you exist or not. Existence is God. You want death or immortality?(cid:148)

Prof: (cid:147)I want neither death nor immortality. I do not want immortality, because the world is
so bad and full of miseries that immortality would mean eternal suffering. I do not want death,
because nobody wants death.(cid:148)

Siva: (cid:147)You are confusing yourself. When you say that you do not want death, it means that

you want immortality. Immortality is God. You want pain or bliss?(cid:148)

Prof : (cid:147)I want neither pain nor bliss.(cid:148)

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A THEIST AND AN ATHEIST

Golmal (Atheist): O Ram! Please show me your God or Brahman of whom you speak very

highly every day. If God really exists, I should see Him with my own eyes now.

Ram (Theist): I will beat you now with this stick. Please show me your pain in concrete

form.

to feel the pain oneself.

Golmal: How can I show you my pain, Ram? Your question is quite absurd. One will have

Ram: Similar is the case with God, also, O Golmal. You will have to realise Him through
constant and intense meditation. He cannot be seen by these fleshy eyes, as He is beyond the reach
of the senses and the mind.

Golmal: If God is beyond the reach of the senses then He should be a non-entity, a mere
void, a negative concept, a metaphysical abstraction, I do not wish to attain such a negative state of
nothingness. I will not gain anything by attaining Him. I am very happy here when I enjoy the
different kinds of sensual objects. There is nothing beyond these sensual pleasures. Why do you
talk of something beyond the senses? How could this be? I cannot believe such things. I am a
scientist. I want accurate laboratory proofs.

Ram: Ha! ha! ha! ha! Well said, Golmal. You want laboratory proofs? Very fine, indeed!
You wish to limit the illimitable all-pervading God in your test-tube, blow-pipe and chemicals. God
is the source for your chemicals. He is the substratum for your atoms, electrons and molecules.
Without Him no atom or electron will move. He is the inner ruler (Antaryamin). He is the Niyanta
(controller). Without Him the fire cannot burn, the sun cannot shine, the air cannot move. Without
Him you cannot see, cannot talk, cannot hear, cannot think. He is the maker of all scientific laws,
the law of gravitation, the law of cohesion, the law of attraction and repulsion, etc. He is law-giver.
Bow to Him with faith and devotion. You will have a thorough knowledge of the Science of
sciences, Brahma Vidya, through His grace, and attain Moksha.

Golmal: Is there anything like the Science of sciences? I had my education at Oxford and

Harvard Universities. I never heard there of a science like this.

Ram: Just note the conversation that took place between Saunaka and Angiras. Saunaka, the
great Grihastha questioned Angiras (cid:147)Kasmin bhagavo vijnate
sarvamidam vijnatam
bhavati(cid:148)(cid:151)(cid:147)What is that which being known all these become known?(cid:148) Angiras replied, (cid:147)It is
Brahma Vidya, the Science of sciences, by knowing which the Immortal Brahman is realised.(cid:148) By
knowledge of Brahma Vidya or the Science of sciences you hear what cannot be heard, you
perceive what cannot be perceived, you know what cannot be known. You think what cannot be
thought of. Just as by the knowledge of a single nugget of gold all that is made of gold is known, the
difference being only a name arising from speech, but the truth being that all is gold, just as by the

28

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A THEIST AND AN ATHEIST

knowledge of a single pair of nail-scissors all that is made of iron is known(cid:151)all modifications
being only a name based upon words, but the truth being that all is iron(cid:151)thus, O Golmal, is that
Brahma Vidya or the Science of sciences.

The basis for all the secular sciences is Brahma Vidya or Adhyatmic Science. If you know
this supreme science through direct intuition, you will have knowledge of all other worldly
sciences, just as you will have knowledge of articles made of clay if you have a knowledge of clay
itself. You cannot learn this Science of sciences in any University. You will have to learn this from a
Brahma-Srotri, Brahma-Nishtha Guru, after controlling your senses and the mind.

Golmal: How can I believe that God exists when I cannot see Him actually with my eyes?

Ram: Though you do not see the stars in the day time, yet they do exist. Though you cannot
see the sun during a cloudy day, yet it does exist. Even so though you cannot see God with these
physical eyes, yet He does exist. If you get the divine eye or the eye of intuition (Jnana Chakshus)
by the practice of meditation, you will behold Him.

Golmal: I think, O Ram! that there is no such thing as God or immortal soul or divine eyes or
eternal bliss of the soul. It is all the wild imaginations of the so-called Vedantins and Bhaktas. Just
as red colour is produced by the combination of lime, nut and betel leaves, so also this body is
formed by the combination of the five elements. This body only is the soul. There is nothing beyond
this body. There is nothing beyond sensual enjoyments. The philosophy of flesh or the philosophy
of Virochana or the Epicurean, (cid:147)Eat, drink and be merry,(cid:148) appeals to me most. We should extract as
much pleasure as possible from this body and the sensual objects. There is no use in practising
penance or self-restraint. We should allow the Indriyas to run riot or to have a free play with the
sensual objects. This is the only wisdom. Fasting, observing Mouna (silence), celibacy, meditation,
etc., are the foolish acts of an ignorant man.

Ram: These worldly objects are ephemeral. They wear out the vigour of all senses. Even the
longest life is very short. No man can be made permanently happy by wealth, sons and woman. Man
weeps in old age. He is drowned in sorrow when he loses money, when his wife or son dies, when he
develops incurable disease. Nachiketas was not tempted by the worldly gifts of Lord Yama. He
persisted in attaining the eternal bliss of the Immortal Soul and got it through the instructions of
Lord Yama. A passionate, ignorant man, who has neither discrimination nor dispassion, who is
drowned in worldliness cannot have a clear conception of the Supreme Tattva.

Golmal: O Ram! Nature only does everything. Why should we accept the existence of God?
Nature nourishes. Nature is everything. This world can go on without an Ishvara or Lord. Nature
can manage everything.

Ram: Nature is not independent. She is the hand-maid of the Lord of Nature. Nature is His
Shakti or illusory power. Just as clay is to the potter, so is Nature to the Lord. The Lord gazes at
Prakriti or Nature. He is the Primum mobile. He sets the Prakriti in motion. Then the Prakriti starts
Her activities. Just as heat is inseparable from the fire, so also Shakti is inseparable from the Lord
(Shakta or possessor of Shakti). Just as the power of burning is inherent in fire, so also Shakti is
inherent in the Lord.

29

GOD EXISTS

Golmal: What are the chief attributes of your Lord?

Ram: God is omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent and All-merciful.

Golmal: Can He make a two-sided paper only one-sided? Can He make a man jump on his
own shoulders? Can He make the fire burn downwards? Can He make the sun radiate coolness?
Can He make a barren woman(cid:146)s son father of seven children? If He cannot do these things, He is no
longer the Omnipotent Lord.

Ram: Do not ask such impertinent, useless and meaningless questions. Spiritual-minded
person will never talk a word in vain. You are wasting your life, time and energy. God is
Omnipotent. He can do and undo things in the twinkling of an eye. His grace makes the dumb man
eloquent and the cripple a mountaineer. Develop Sraddha (faith) and Bhakti (devotion). Utilize
your body in His service. It is very difficult to get a human birth; therefore try your best to realise
Him in this birth. Try to become wise. Learn to discriminate. Cultivate your heart. Make it soft and
pure.

Golmal: O Ram! You say, (cid:147)God is All-merciful.(cid:148) I say, (cid:147)God is very cruel. He is very
unjust. He makes some very rich; others very poor; some healthy and others very sickly and
deformed from their very birth.(cid:148)

Ram: God is quite just. He is the silent witness. This world runs in accordance with definite
laws. There is order. Virtue brings its own reward; vice brings its own punishment. God neither
punishes nor rewards any individual. Man reaps the fruits of his own actions. As he sows, so he
reaps, The law of cause and effect operates. This law is inexorable.

Golmal: Why God created this world? When He is Purnakama, i.e., one in whom all desires

are gratified, how did the desire to create this world arise in His mind?

Ram: Why God created this world? When did Karma begin? Why should there be ignorance
at all? When did man take his first birth? How can ignorance come in the Atma who is of the nature
of Satchidananda? Which is more powerful whether Prarabdha (destiny) or Purushartha
(self-effort)? and many such other questions are Atiprasnas, transcendental questions. Such
questions do not help in any way one(cid:146)s progress in the spiritual path. The result is mere lingual
warfare and beating about the bush with no substantial result. Words are finite. Language is
imperfect. One can get a solution to such questions only when one transcends the three states and
the three Gunas, and rests in one(cid:146)s own essential Svarupa, through constant and protracted
Nididhyasan and attains Dridhabhumi or Yogarudha (established in Yoga) state. The frail, finite
intellect that is conditioned in time, space, causation cannot peep into the beyond. You will get
answers for these questions when you get knowledge of the Self.

All doubts are rent asunder, the three knots are broken when one attains Brahmic Sthiti or
Sahaja-Avastha (natural-state) or the native state of pristine purity and glory. People generally rack
their brains and waste their energy when such doubts assail them. This is a trick of the mind to
delude the aspirant and swerve them from the path of divine contemplation. What is wanted is

30

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A THEIST AND AN ATHEIST

rigorous Sadhana, burning Vairagya (dispassion), strong Mumukshutva (desire for liberation) and
sustained discrimination.

Golmal: If God is All-merciful, if He is an ocean of mercy, why should there be pain and

disease in this world?

Ram: Pain is, in a way, a good thing in this world. It is an eye-opener. It is a blessing in
disguise. It infuses mercy in your heart and turns your mind towards God. It develops your
will-power or power of endurance. It forces you to find out the way of escape from the clutches of
Maya or the thraldom of matter.

Golmal: Why should there be evil in this world? Can He not create a world with pure bliss
only? Why should there be mixture of pleasure and pain? Does this not go against His Omnipotent
nature?

Ram: This universe is a mixture of good and evil. This is a relative plane. You cannot expect
pure, unalloyed happiness here. You can find pure bliss in your innermost Self or Brahman only.
Evil is not a distinct entity. Good and evil are the obverse and reverse sides of the same coin. Evil
exists to glorify good. What is evil at one time is good at another time. What is evil for one is good
for another. A rogue is a saint of the future. If you keep him in the company of a saint he will
become a veritable Mahatma. Have you not studied the lives of Ratnakar, Jagai and Madhai? They
became very good saints when they came in contact with great souls. The body of a man is the result
of good and evil actions. Therefore he should reap the fruits of his good and evil actions, viz.,
pleasure and pain.

Golmal: O Ram! Thank you very much, indeed. My mind is slightly turned towards your
side by your impressive instructions. Please give me some strong proofs for the existence of God. I
am led to believe now that Supreme Intelligence or Power governs this universe.

Ram: God or Brahman is Svatah-Siddha (self-proved). The Self is the basis of the action of
proving. Therefore, it is evident before the action of proving itself. It is therefore impossible to deny
it. In denying the existence of Brahman, you deny your own existence, which is absurd. Brahman is
the basis of all pre-suppositions, demonstrations and all notions.

Golmal: I have understood this point well. Doubtless the Self cannot be demonstrated. But it
is possible to infer His existence from certain empirical facts. Please furnish me with those facts.
Then I will have perfect conviction.

Ram: The existence of Brahman is known on the ground of its being the Self of everyone,
because everyone is conscious of the existence of his Self. There is an inherent feeling in
everybody, (cid:145)I exist(cid:151)Aham Asmi.(cid:146) Man never thinks, (cid:145)I am not.(cid:146) This self of whose existence all
are conscious is Brahman.

Golmal: Well said, indeed! I can understand this point very well. It appears to me nicely.

Please teach me further in this direction.

31

GOD EXISTS

Ram: Close your eyes and imagine for a moment that you are dead.

Golmal: Yes. I have closed my eyes now. I now imagine that I am dead.

Ram: What do you find now?

Golmal: I imagine that my dead body is lying down on the ground as a corpse and I am

witnessing the dead body.

Ram: You can never imagine of your annihilation. You can never think that you do not exist
after the physical body is thrown away. This itself clearly proves that you are always the witnessing
subject (Sakshi, Drashta).

Golmal: This also convinces me to some extent. Please give me some more practical

illustrations.

Ram: O Golmal! Here is a very practical illustration. You dream sometimes that you are
dead and that your relatives are weeping. Even in that supposed death-state you see and hear them
weeping. This clearly indicates that even after seeming death, life really persists. This also proves
that immortality is an inherent attribute of the soul. You exist even after the physical sheath is
thrown out. That existence is Brahman or Atma.

Golmal: Ram, this is really a wonderful illustration. My doubts about the existence of God

or Self are dwindling. Please give me some instructions from the experiences in daily life.

Ram: A certain lady had a fall from the third story of her house. Underneath there was a bed
of sharp angular stones. She would have received very serious injuries, but she was miraculously
saved. She herself expressed, (cid:147)I actually felt the warm embrace of some invisible hands. Some
mysterious power saved me.(cid:148) Instances like this are not uncommon in daily life.

Golmal: May I hear another illustration?

Ram: You find that even the world(cid:146)s best doctors fail to cure a dying king. You might have
also heard of many instances where patients ailing from the worst type of diseases are cured
miraculously, where even the ablest doctors have declared the case to be hopeless. This itself is a
clear proof that there is the Divine Hand behind all cure.

Golmal: Can you illustrate this through the theory of Karma?

Ram: Some people die when they are eighty years old; some die when they are in the womb;
some die at twenty; some at forty. What is the cause for the variation? Who has fixed the span of life
for all? This clearly proves that there is the theory of Karma, that there is one Omniscient Lord who
is the Dispenser of the fruits of the actions of the Jivas, who fixed the span of the life of the Jivas in
accordance with their nature of Karma or action, who knows the exact relation between Karmas and
their fruits. As Karma is Jada or insentient, it certainly cannot dispense with the fruits of their
actions.

32

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A THEIST AND AN ATHEIST

Golmal: Prove the existence of God through facts about this physical body which is

regarded as the temple of God.

Rama: The insentient engine of a railway train cannot move without a qualified driver. Even
so this insentient body-engine cannot move without an intelligent driver, who is God or Ishvar.
From the existence of the body you can infer the existence of the hidden driver of the body-engine.

Mark! There is display of intelligence in every inch of creation. Who pumps blood into the
arteries? Who converts food into chyle and red-coloured blood? Who effects the peristalsis in the
bowels and stomach and controls the process of assimilation and elimination. Who shuts the eye
lids to prevent dust from falling into the delicate eyes? Who gave intelligence to the cells and glands
to secrete milk, bile, saliva, gastric juice, etc., from the blood? Who gave intelligence and power to
the spermatozoa to move, unite with the ovum in the womb and develop into a foetus? Wherefrom
does this minutest, subtlest substance, Jiva, as minute as the tiniest grain of sand, derive the capacity
to assume gradually the features, complexion and shape of its parents? What is the power which
sustains it and helps its growth in the mother(cid:146)s womb? Who arranges for milk in the mother(cid:146)s breast
before the child is born ?

How wonderful is the human machine? How harmoniously all the organs work in unison in
the economy of nature? In Gita this body is known as navadvara-puri or nine-gate city. In summer
the skin works energetically to throw off all impurities of the blood and to relieve the kidneys which
had over-worked in winter. The endocrine, pituitary, pineal, adrenal glands work in perfect
harmony in manufacturing the internal secretions, and the hormones to help the metabolic process
of the body, growth and structure.

It is a great marvel to see the working of the nervous system under the control of brain and
the movement of the impulses through the spinal cord. There is a magnificent, electric battery
inside with switchboard and wires. The operator is Antaryamin (inner ruler, or God) who controls
and supervises everything. He is Upadrashta (supervisor), Anumanta (permitter) and Maheswar
(the great Lord). Look at the heart and lungs which work under the direct control of the brain. How
wonderful are these three vital organs the tripods of life? Can an eminent scientist manufacture any
of these organs, tissues, fibres, tendons or cells in his laboratory with his intellects?

How harmoniously the different systems such as the digestive system, circulatory system,
nervous system, integumentary system, work without any rest! How beautifully the different
centres in the brain such as the vision-centre, authority-centre, centre of smell, etc., do their
functions. One is struck with awe and wonder when he begins to think seriously of the structure and
working of this delicate human machinery.

To think that this most wonderful mechanism is the result and product of a fortuitous
combination of matter or atoms is simply absurd and ridiculous indeed! It has been, doubtless,
moulded and fashioned by some architect, who is infinitely more skilful, intelligent and powerful
than the ordinary architects who build palaces and bungalows. That architect is God or Ishvar or
Creator. Call him by any name. It does not matter much.

Golmal: Give me facts for the existence of God by the study of mind and its functions.

33

GOD EXISTS

Ram: Unless there exists one continuous principle equally connected with the past, present
and future, or an absolutely unchangeable Self which cognizes everything, we are unable to account
for remembrance, recognition and so on, which are subject to mental impression on place, time and
cause. The Self is distinct from and superior to ideas, because the ideas require an ultimate principle
which unites and connects them, while the Self is itself the ultimate Principle which renders the
cognition of the ideas possible.

The Manas (mind) is an organ of sensation and thought. It must be under the control of some
one who uses this instrument. The Jiva or human soul is not the director of the mind, because we see
that ordinary men are swayed away ruthlessly by the mind. Therefore, there must exist some other
Supreme Being, who is the Director of the mind. He is the Antaryamin, the inner Ruler and
Controller.

Then again look at the miraculous power of the mind. In the Kenopanishad the first Mantra
begins, (cid:145)Who is the Director of the mind?(cid:146) There is the play of the Divine hand here also. Can my
brother psychologist manufacture a mind from his laboratory? We are struck with wonder when we
look into the diverse faculties of the mind, viz., power of discrimination, power of judgment,
reasoning,
the power of
reflection,
understanding, etc. No one but God can create such a powerful and miraculous mind.

imagination, cogitative faculty or

retentive power,

Golmal: Give me facts for His existence from the study of nature.

Ram: Who provides food for the little frog that lives hidden between the strata of rocks?
Who has clothed the fruits with skin to prevent contamination from outside? Who divided the
season? Who made the water warm beneath the ice to enable the fishes to live comfortably in the icy
regions of the Himalayas, and other places? Who has combined four parts of nitrogen with the one
part of oxygen?

At whose command does the sun rise in the morning and set in the evening? The sun is
92,830,000 miles away from the earth. What a great wonder that from such a long distance the sun
is able to convey light, heat, energy and vitality to all the living beings who inhabit the earth. There
are millions of suns larger and smaller than the one which we see, but which appear to us like tiny
stars on account of their being remoter than the sun with which we are acquainted. It takes millions
of years for the light from these stars to reach this earth. Velocity of light is 186,000 miles per
second. Light from some distant stars has not yet reached us even now. What a great marvel it is! All
these stars, planets, and satellites are revolving in the sky in fixed orbits from day to day, month to
month and year to year, under immutable, definite laws. God is the Niyanta (controller). The sun
cannot shine without Him. Fire cannot burn without Him.

Who supplies water to the trees, flowers, various shrubs, etc., that are found in this world?
Who is this unseen, untiring gardener who works without wages or any sort of remuneration? Who
gives nourishment in time to tigers, lions, birds, fishes, plants, insects, worms, etc.? How is it that
only human beings are born of human beings, birds of birds, tigers of tigers, dogs of dogs, horses of
horses, elephants of elephants, ants of ants, bears of bears, mules of mules,(cid:151)an exact copy of their
parents in every respect? From a tiny seed there springs a huge banyan tree that can give shelter for
thousands of persons. From a tiny seed there comes out a big mango tree that gives thousands of

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A THEIST AND AN ATHEIST

delicious fruits. What is that power which supports and nourishes these trees? What is that hidden,
miraculous power that brings out huge form with hair, fingers, toes, eyes, nose, teeth, ears, legs,
thighs, etc., out of a tiny embryo? What is that power that brings out a mighty tree with foliage,
flowers, twigs and fruit out of a tiny seed?

Golmal: Can you explain the meaning of the Ekasloki of Sri Sankara?

Ram: In the day time what gives you light? Sun. At night when there is no sun, what gives
you light? Moon, stars and lamps. When there are no sun, moon, stars and lamps what gives you
(cid:145)light(cid:146)? Eyes. What gives you (cid:145)light(cid:146) when the eyes are closed? Buddhi or intellect. Who finds out
the defect in the intellect whether there is clarity or turbidity? Aham (I). That Aham is the Light of
lights or the eternal Soul or Atman or the Infinite.

Golmal: What can we infer from the study of deep sleep? The Vedantins talk much of deep

sleep. What is the difference between sleep and Samadhi?

Ram: In sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind and yet you experience the highest
bliss without a concrete awareness. When there are no objects, wherefrom have you derived the
bliss? The mind rests in Brahman during sleep, and it is from Brahman that bliss is derived. Further,
during sleep when there are no other persons, (cid:145)I(cid:146) alone exists.

In sleep you experience Avidya-Avrita Sukha. There is a veil between you and the Self. You
do not return to the waking state with intuitional knowledge, you are ignorant; whereas in Samadhi
you get knowledge of the Self, you enjoy directly the eternal bliss of the Self as there is no veil.
Your ignorance is destroyed in Samadhi.

Golmal: Give me a very simple, but very impressive proof for the existence of Soul.

Ram: You say in daily life, (cid:145)my body,(cid:146) (cid:145)my Prana,(cid:146) (cid:145)my mind,(cid:146) (cid:145)my Indriya.(cid:146) This clearly
denotes that the Self or Atma is entirely different from body, mind, Prana and Indriyas. Mind and
body are your servants or instruments. They areas much outside of you as these towels, chairs, cups

attain this Immortal Self.

Ram: Purify the mind. Control the senses. Develop the four means. Hear the Srutis. Reflect

and meditate. You will attain Self-realisation.

CAN EXISTENCE OF GOD BE PROVED

SYMPOSIUM

CAN EXISTENCE OF GOD BE PROVED

Prof. K. Satchidanandamurty

[Head of the Dept. of Philosophy, Andhra University]

Since the time when Plato, in his Tenth Book of the Laws, formulated a proof for the
existence of God, the dominant note of Western Philosophy has been to regard the existence of God
as a conclusion to be established by means of argument. The tradition of theological proof was
passed on to Christian philosophy and theology through Aristotle. It was only in the second half of
the eighteenth century that the proof for the existence of God came to be seriously challenged. The
two greatest thinkers of the time, Hume and Kant, exposed the logical flaws and invalidity of the
theological arguments.

But Kant allowed an argument which reaches God through the testimony of moral
consciousness. Later, thinkers like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Kierkegaard and others have raised a
formidable objection against not only the particular proof but against the very idea of such proofs.
Assurance of God(cid:146)s existence has come to those who have been confronted by God(cid:146)s Presence,
while those who have been denied it have never been convinced by proofs. As Haecker has said it is
absurd and insulting to set about proving the existence of an ever present entity(cid:151)God. (cid:147)We can no
more prove God(cid:146)s existence,(cid:148) wrote De Burgh, (cid:147)than we can prove that of our fellowman; our
knowledge of the one as of the other is founded on the experience of their presence.(cid:148)

Self-Disclosing Entity

Modern thought in thus breaking away from the tradition of theistic proof is returning closer
to the Biblical as well as the Upanishadic point of view. The Upanishads at several places maintain
that the knowledge of the Supreme or the Brahman is a great mystery to be communicated only to
the deserving and faithful. In the words of Jesus Christ, it is not given unto all to know the mysteries
of the Kingdom of Heaven, (cid:147)For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance.(cid:148) Brahman is revealed only to him who is chosen and favoured by the Creator. We
cannot know God unless He discloses Himself. He is not a sensible entity which we can come
across in perceptual experience. Moreover, He is a self-conscious being. We can know about a
self-conscious being only when we come into contact with Him, and even then we can not know
much about His life, His purposes etc., by external observation. We may guess something about His
nature from His acts, but these guesses have as much likelihood of being wrong as of being right. So
the best way we can know Him is through His self-disclosure.

Perfect knowledge of God is attainable only when He chooses to reveal Himself. We cannot
know anything about God from His acts, because unless we know Him we cannot know which are
His acts; and even if something can be known about Him from His acts, we cannot do so unless God
wills so. God is not like any other person about whom we can know something in spite of Himself.
He is present both in us as well as apart from us, and whatever we do or know is willed by Him. So,
if at all we can have any knowledge of God, it is because He has revealed Himself. We do not know

37

GOD EXISTS

Him unless He is pleased to make Himself known. Knowledge of God, in whatever way we may
think we have arrived at, comes ultimately from God due to His self-disclosure.

Knowledge Through Intuition

At several places the Upanishads clearly state that intellect or discursive reason is not
adequate to grasp the Supreme. (cid:147)Speech, with the mind, turns away unable to reach it(cid:148). (cid:147)The eye
cannot perceive it, nor can speech describe it, while the mind cannot reach there. We do not know
how we can reach it.(cid:148) (cid:147)The great Spirit transcends the reason.(cid:148) (cid:147)That which one cannot think with
the mind, but that by which they say the mind is made to think, know that alone to be the Brahman.(cid:148)
(cid:147)It cannot be apprehended by word or eye.(cid:148) (cid:147)Through argumentation, it cannot be grasped.(cid:148) (cid:147)Much
learning, genius, or knowledge of books cannot lead us to the Atman.(cid:148)

That the Brahman cannot be known through a study of the Vedas is the earlier view
maintained by the Upanishads. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Janaka who has studied the
Vedas and heard the Upanishads confesses that he is ignorant of what will become to him when he
is dead. In the Chhandogya Upanishad, Narada who has studied the Vedas, history, science,
philosophy, fine arts, politics and the art of warfare, confesses that he is only a knower of scriptures
and not of the Atman, and so he was still plunged in misery. In both of these Upanishads, Svetaketu,
the son of Aruni, who was well-taught by his father in all branches of learning, confesses to
Pravahana Jaivali that he does not know the mysteries of death and birth; and in Chhandogya
Upanishad, after a twelve year study of the Vedas, Svetaketu is still depicted as ignorant of that by
knowing which all that is unheard is heard and all that is unknown is known.

The Mundaka Upanishad finally sums up this trend of thought by saying that all the four
Vedas and the six Vedangas are inferior knowledge, while superior knowledge is that by which the
Imperishable is known. The Brihadaranyaka, therefore, advises us not to study too many books, as
that is only a cause of fatigue, but to cultivate Prajna or intuition. Having spurned scholarship, the
seeker after Brahman should become like a child. This reminds us of Christ(cid:146)s teaching, (cid:147)Except ye
be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.(cid:148)

Acme Of The Vedas

Later, when the Upanishadic doctrine of the Atman, which first arose in Kshatriya circles,
gained the respect of Brahmanas, and when in spite of its opposition to the Vedic cult of gods and
sacrifices, the Brahmanas eagerly sought and mastered it. The Upanishads became Vedanta. Soon
Brahmanas like Yajnavalkya became not only adepts of Vedanta, but developed Atmavidya to the
highest limit, and the Vedanta was made the acme of the Vedas. In Yajnavalkya(cid:146)s question, (cid:147)I ask
you of that person who is known through the Upanishads alone(cid:148), we find it mentioned for the first
time that the Upanishads are the source of the knowledge of the Brahman.

The Chhandogya says that while the Vedas are nectar, the Upanishads are the Guhya
Adesa(cid:151)the most secret teaching. The Mundaka finally sums up this tendency by saying that those
who have rightly ascertained the nature of the Brahman from the wisdom of the Vedanta are
liberated after death. The Svetasvatara says that the most profound secret is disclosed in the
Vedanta only. This position later crystalized itself and, as stated by Badarayana, it then became

38

CAN EXISTENCE OF GOD BE PROVED

the
classical. Unanimously and emphatically Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva assert
knowledge of the Brahman can be gained through the study, meditation and contemplation
(Sravana, Manana, Nididhyasana) of the Upanishadic Mahavakyas alone.

that

(cid:145)Via Salutis(cid:146)

Though Brahma-Jnana is the final means of liberation, there must be a (cid:145)Via salutis(cid:146) for it.
Study of the Vedas, sacrifice, charity, austerity and desirelessness are the ways in which Brahmanas
seek to know the Brahman.
In Kena Upanishad, austerity, self-restraint, Karma and
Veda-Vedangas are said to be the foundation of Brahma-Vidya. All the same, sacrifices and charity
cannot by themselves lead to knowledge of the Brahman. Yajnavalkya contemptuously remarks,
(cid:147)What are sacrifices after all but beasts(cid:148), i.e., slaughter of beasts. Sacrifices can only take one to the
world of Manes. As the Mundaka says, they are fools who think that Vedic sacrifices and charitable
works like digging of tanks, etc., bring about the good. That is why King Janasruti, though very
charitable and munificent, had yet to sit at the feet of a poor peripatetic to learn about the Brahman.

Similarly, though austerity or Tapas leads to knowledge, by itself it cannot reveal the
Brahman. The Chhandogya says that Yajna, Adhyayana and Dana, which form the first step of
Dharma, Tapas the second step, and Brahmacharya the third step, lead only to the Punyaloka and
not to Immortality, which is gained only by him who is firmly established in the Brahman. Even a
thousand years of sacrifice and Tapas cannot lead to Mukti, for that could be had only by
Brahma-Vedanam-knowledge of the Brahman. In short, Vedic study, sacrifices, Dana and Tapas
are the external means to Brahma-Jnana, because they are acts which purify one and make one a fit
recipient of Jnana. The immediate preliminaries to Brahma-Jnana are self-control, quiescence,
withdrawal into oneself, endurance, and concentration. As the Katha Upanishad says, the sinner,
the sensual, the unstable and one who lacks concentration, cannot attain intuition.

Need Of A Guru

After equipping oneself with the purity of the will, feeling and intellect, one should
approach the teacher for inculcation into the secrets of the Upanishads. As a man brought
blindfolded from some place and left in a desert cannot find his way unaided, even so, we cannot
shake off Samsara and gain Mukti, until we receive instruction from a teacher. Except through a
good teacher there is no way of knowing the Atman, as it is (cid:145)subtler than the subtle(cid:146) and difficult to
be known. Sankara explains that a teacher well-studied in the Upanishads alone can teach us about
Brahman. We can hear about the Atman only from the wise. But how could that be taught which (cid:147)by
the eyes cannot be seen, by speech cannot be described and by thought cannot be penetrated?(cid:148) The
Brahman can only be apprehended through Self-realisation.

Though this revelation occupies the fundamental place, intellect has its own allotted orb in
the Vedanta; for reasoning is necessary to ascertain the purport of Vedantavakyas and to be sure of
the probability of what they say. Reasoning is needed to remove doubts and contrary beliefs. As
mind is overburdened with false notions such as a thing like the Brahman cannot exists or that the
Brahman is a material principle, reasoning is necessary to dispel doubts and contrary notions. But in
all such cases reasoning should follow and be dependent upon scripture. Manana is the process of
Vichara or thought which removes the improbability of the Upanishadic statements. Nididhyasana

39

GOD EXISTS

is contemplation of the profound meaning of scripture through concentration, after all contrary
ideas are dispelled. When, thus, Sravana aided by Manana and Nididhyasana has taken place, only
then arises the Sakshatkara, or the final intuition of the Brahman.

Om Tat Sat Brahmarpanamastu

PHILOSOPHICAL PROOFS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

Sri Swami Krishnananda

The foundations of religion are in the concepts of God, the world and the individual, and all
its other phases arise from a consideration of the relationship obtaining among these three
metaphysical principles. The Vedas, Upanishads, Epics, Puranas and Agamas establish themselves
on the avowed acceptance of this threefold reality, whose existence is taken for granted as an article
of unquestionable faith or direct intuition and experience. The history of humanity has, however,
been showing indications of its drifting more and more through the process of time away from the
ability to know things by direct insight or experience, and the observation has been that
psychological history is moving towards a greater dependence on sense and reason as the only
faculties available by which anything can be known at all. Scriptural authority gives place to logical
enquiry and philosophical investigation. While the existence of the individual person is a matter of
empirical experience in everyday life, and the perception of a world outside also follows as a
necessary corollary of the fact of the individual having an environment around, the available
faculties of knowledge segregated from the possibility of insight and immediate experience find
themselves at a loss when confronting such a problem as the existence of God.

Philosophers have mostly been rational expounders of the validity of religious values,
though we have also among philosophers those who are atheists, agnostics, empiricists, sceptics
and materialists. The major trend, however, of philosophical disquisitions has been along the line of
a common acceptance of there being such a thing as a reality transcending the world, whose nature
requires to be known and established on firm grounds. Plato, in the West, was constrained to land
himself in a world of (cid:145)Ideas(cid:146) ruled by the (cid:145)Idea of the Good,(cid:146) above the empirical world of
sense-perception, the latter being just a shadow cast by the arrangement of the eternal (cid:145)Ideas(cid:146). To
Aristotle, God is the Unmoved Mover, towards whom everything gravitates as if pulled by a
powerful magnet, and all the variety and the material shapes of things tend gradually to unfold an
essential form which enlarges itself in an ascending series of the evolution of form, until Pure Form,
which is God, is reached as the ultimate discovery of logical philosophy. Kant denied the possibility
of knowing God through understanding and reason, holding that the reality in itself cannot be
contacted through the rational faculties of man, which are limited in their operation to the
phenomena of space, time and the psychological categories of quantity, quality, relation and
modality. But he inadvertently seems to be admitting the existence of a super-phenomenal reality, a
thing-in-itself, when he denies the possibility of knowing it. Hegel took up the cause of reason and
propounded it as a universally pervasive principle, which, by positive, negative and synthesising

40

PHILOSOPHICAL PROOFS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

processes rises gradually to higher and higher forms of the synthesis of knowledge until the
Ultimate Synthesis, the Absolute, is reached.

The existence of God has been an intriguing theme that occupied the minds of the

philosophers throughout the ages:

1. It has been held that the concept of God implies at the same time the concept of the
infinite, and such a concept cannot arise in the mind of anyone unless the infinite really exists.
Thoughts cannot arise from a vacuum. Consciousness cannot have a location; its realm is
infinitude. The concept of God as the perfect being should be regarded as proof enough,
ontologically, of the existence of a reality which is God.

2. Further it is seen that in the world everything is a manifestation of some cause behind it,
so that we may hold that the world in its entirety, which discloses the nature of an effect on account
of its transiency and urge for onward evolution, can be explained only in terms of a cause behind it,
which itself cannot be transient or subject to evolutionary process. Evolution is a tendency to
outgrow oneself in a higher state of affairs and evolution itself would be meaningless if it is not to
end in an achievement which is its purpose. Cosmic evolution is accountable only on the existence
of a cosmic God who Himself is not caused by anything prior to Him. God is timeless eternity.

3. The precision and method with which the world is seen to be working with its sun and
moon and galaxies can only be the work of an Architect who designs and fashions this perfectly
ordered way of the working of things, Whose existence should be as certain as the artistic workings
of Nature as a whole.

4. The finitude of every form of individuality implies a consciousness of one(cid:146)s finitude, and
the consciousness of finitude spontaneously suggests a consciousness of that which is not finite.
What is not finite is infinite, which is exactly the description of God.

5. There is also a tendency in people to ask for more and more of things, and such an asking
would have no significance if it cannot be granted or fulfilled. The (cid:145)more(cid:146) has to culminate in a
possibility of its utter attainment in a state of perfection, where the (cid:145)more(cid:146) melts into the (cid:145)most,(cid:146) the
superlative endlessness, where the sense of more reaches its finale.

6. Further, our moral sense, which commands us to do good and not bad, expects a
corresponding reward for such a behaviour of discipline, but for which there would be no incentive
to be good or do good. The dispenser of justice behind good and bad deeds has to be someone
beyond the world of good and bad, and such a one, obviously, has to be an infinite being.

7. Since the consciousness of anything defies divisibility, the consciousness of division
itself requiring an abolition of the consciousness of division, consciousness ever manages to remain
divisionless, that is, infinite. This infinitude is the nature of true existence,(cid:151)God.

8. There cannot be a consciousness of the object by the subject, unless there is a
transcendent conscious principle relating the subject and the object, and yet, by itself, transcending
subject-object relation, which would be the veritable Infinite. We call it God.

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

GOD EXISTS

Sri Swami Krishnananda

The Existence Of God

The transcendent Brahman does not bear any relation to the universe. The nature of its
existence is such that it cannot have distinctions within it or outside it. It is free from the threefold
differentiation: Sajatiya, Vijatiya and Svagata (homogeneous, hetrogeneous and internal
differences). It is beyond the world in every sense of the term, and cannot be discovered in anything
that we can hope to know. The perishable does not satisfy our quest for the eternal. Brahman is
Nishprapancha, Prapanchopasama, a being which is free from the universe, and in which the
universe ceases to be. But without holding allegiance to the existence of Brahman, the world cannot
be. The world is dependent on Brahman. In this respect, the names and forms and activities of the
world are directed by Brahman; the world automatically receives, in different degrees, inspiration
and reality from the existence, consciousness and bliss of Brahman. Brahman envisaged thus by the
individuals, as the supreme Cause and the Director of the universe, is Isvara, the Cosmic Being.
Isvara is omnipresent, for He supports and animates every speck of creation by His immanence. He
is omniscient, for He has a direct intuition of all things, manifest and unmanifest. He is also the
Divine Self and the Inner Ruler of the cosmos. The knowledge which Isvara has of the universe is
not relational, not brought about by a mental function, and does not labour under the limitations of
space and time, but immediate in its essence and spirit. It is not any outside knowledge of an object,
but knowledge as the being of the object itself. He is omnipotent, for He has the power to do, undo
or transform the universe as a whole, for the universe is His Body. He is called the Creator of the
universe, for it is He that initiates the appearance of all things by the activity of His consciousness.
This work of Isvara never comes to a cessation until the universe is withdrawn into Him, and this
process is felt and continues in different degrees, in every bit of His creation. He is the Preserver of
the universe, as the sustenance of all life requires the operation of His Spirit. His existence and
activity are felt by us wherever and whenever we think of Him intensely. He is the Destroyer or the
final transformer of the universe, into whom the universe is withdrawn in the end, to whom all
beings return on the completion of the working out of their deeds in the present cycle. Isvara is the
natural and necessary counter-correlative of the world taken as an object of individualistic
observation.

The characteristics of Isvara, as enumerated above, are the Tatasthalakshanas or the
accidental attributes of Brahman. The appearance of Brahman as Isvara continues as long as there is
the experience of the world and the individual. The fact that there is an observer implies that there is
an external world. And the fact of the existence of an objective world, again, entails the recognition
of a supreme Creator and Director of beings. If there is an individual, there ought to be a world, and
if there is a world, there ought to be God. Isvara, Jagat and Jiva-God, the world and the
individual-go together, one implying the others, and not being possible without the others. The
three principles are the basic contents of all relative experience.

The concept of God involves certain unavoidable presuppositions, if it is to stand the test of
reason. We are obliged to hold that God must be one, and not more than one. A perfect God ought to
be self-dependent, and a plurality or even a duality of gods would introduce a kind of limitation and

42

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

dependence. A universe with many gods cannot be governed harmoniously, for there would be
conflict of purpose among them. The system and order in Nature demand that the Sovereign of the
universe must be one. God ought to be an uncaused reality, and though everything of which God is
the cause has to be in space and time, God, who is the causeless Cause, is above space and time. The
sequence of effects which proceed from God is more logical than chronological. As the final goal of
all beings, God directs all movements towards Himself by an upward pull, as it were, by being the
determining destination of the entire creation. He is the fulfilment of all aspirations and needs, and
the realisation of Him is the great blessedness of any mortal. God has a direct knowledge of the
inner workings of Nature, in their completest detail. Though He transcends all individual values, He
is the conservation of all values, and constitutes their eternal home. In Him all values exist in their
truest essence. Not only this, God Himself is the highest value and end of universal existence. To
realise Him is to rise to the centre of the cosmos and to rule it with unlimited knowledge and
suzerainty. Man realises his ideals more and more as and when his consciousness approximates, in
greater and greater degree, the being of God. The deeper the realisation, the more inward is the
manner in which the values are enjoyed in a condition which tends to advance towards infinitude, in
which the remoteness of ideals gets expanded into a boundless Spirit, with neither inside nor
outside. God is the be-all and the end-all of creation.

Arguments For The Existence Of God

St. Thomas Aquinas advances five proofs for the existence of God. The first is the argument
from motion, which holds that all motion presupposes the existence of something which is not itself
subject to motion. Motion implies a motionless ground. The motion that characterises the world
ought to be logically preceded by an unmoved Mover, an ultimate being who is not moved by
anything else, who ought to be the basis of the motion of all things. The second is the causal
argument that, as every effect has a cause, the causal chain would lead to an endless regress if a final
uncaused Cause is not posited. Without the admission of such a Cause, the very concept of
causality, which holds sway over the world, would lose its meaning. The final cause has, therefore,
no other cause outside itself, it is the final Form without matter in it. The third is the cosmological
argument which points out that all contingent events necessarily imply an eternal substance which
itself is not contingent. The very consciousness of finitude gives rise to the consciousness of the
infinite. The fourth is the henological argument, according to which the concept of more and less in
the things of this world signifies the existence of a maximum value whose manifestation in various
degrees creates in us and in things the idea of more or less of value. The various grades of relative
perfection and imperfection in the world indicate that there ought to be an absolute state whose
partial revelations here give meaning to these relative expressions. The fifth is the teleological
argument or the argument from design and adaptation, which infers the existence of God as the
supreme intelligence, on the basis of the purposive adaptation seen in Nature and the ordered design
for which it appears to be meant. The purpose that is discovered in Nature cannot be accounted for
otherwise than by admitting the presence of a supremely intelligent Creator, a wise Architect of the
universe. The different parts of the universe harmoniously fit in with one another(cid:146)s purposes, and
adjust and adapt themselves for an end beyond themselves. All this shows that there ought to be a
purposive Agent who has brought about all this adaptation, system and order in creation. God,
according to St. Thomas Aquinas, is, therefore, One, the unmoved Mover, the causeless Cause, the
eternal Substance, the highest Perfection, supreme Intelligence, and the Maximum of being.

43

GOD EXISTS

In his treatise on divine government, given in his Summa Theologica, St. Thomas says: (cid:147)I
answer that certain ancient philosophers denied the government of the world, saying that all things
happened by chance. But such an opinion can be refuted as impossible in two ways. First, by the
observation of things themselves. For we observe that in Nature things happen always or nearly
always for the best; which would not be the case unless some sort of Providence directed Nature
towards good as an end. And this is to govern. Therefore, the unfailing order we observe in things is
the sign of their being governed. For instance, if we were to enter a well-ordered house, we would
gather from the order manifested in the house the notion of a governor, as Cicero says, quoting
Aristotle. Secondly, this is clear from a consideration of the divine goodness which, as we have said
above, is the cause of the production of things in being. For, as it belongs to the best to produce the
best, it is not fitting that the supreme goodness of God should produce things without giving them
their perfection. Now a thing(cid:146)s ultimate perfection consists in the attainment of its end. Therefore, it
belongs to the divine goodness, as it brought things into being, so to lead them to their end. And this
is to govern.(cid:148) (cid:147)Hence, as the movement of the arrow towards a definite end shows clearly that it is
directed by someone with knowledge, so the unvarying course of natural things which are without
knowledge shows clearly that the world is governed by some Reason.(cid:148)

St. Thomas argues that as the beginning of the universe is outside itself, the end of all things
in the universe should be a transcendent good which is not to be sought within the universe. The
highest good is the highest end of all beings. As the particular end of anything is a particular form of
good, so the universal end of all things ought to be the universal good, which can only be one. And
this good has to be identified with God, for it is the good of and for itself by virtue of its essence and
existence, whereas a particular good is good only by participation. Every form of good that is
conceivable in the universe is, according to Aquinas, a good only by sharing in a higher good. The
good of the whole world cannot be within itself, but ought to transcend it. Everything under the sun,
in the opinion of Aquinas, is generated and corrupted in accordance with the sun(cid:146)s movement. A
certain amount of chance seems to characterise all that is mundane. And the very fact that an
element of chance is discovered in things here on earth proves that they are subject to a government
of a higher order. For, unless corruptible things were governed by a higher being, there would be no
order but only chaos, no definiteness but only indeterminacy everywhere. Things lacking
knowledge, naturally, get guided by a being endowed with knowledge. All activity in the universe
is intentional and purposive, directed by the supreme decree of God.

Swami Sivananda, accepting the famous arguments for the existence of God,-the
ontological, the cosmological and the theological,-would endorse the theological proofs of St.
Thomas Aquinas. The feeling of the (cid:145)I(cid:146), according to him, is rooted in an existence which cannot be
doubted. The existence of the Self is existence in general, and is enjoyed by everyone. The Self of
everyone bears testimony to the existence of the Self which comprehends the entire universe. This
universal Self is God. Though one is encased in this finite body, one can think and feel: (cid:145)I am
infinite(cid:146), through an irresistible urge which tends to direct all thought towards the achievement of
such being. Such an urge from within cannot possibly be, unless there is a reality to which it points.
(cid:147)You always feel: (cid:145)I exist.(cid:146) You can never deny your existence. Existence is Brahman, your own
inner immortal Self(cid:148) (cid:147)Though I am encased in this finite body, though I am imperfect and mortal on
account of egoism, I can think of the infinite, the perfect, the immortal being. This idea of the
infinite can arise only from an infinite being(cid:148) (Wisdom Nectar, p. 188).

44

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

Swami Sivananda observes that the concept of the finite posits the infinite. (cid:147)Everything is
changing in this world. There must be a substratum that is unchanging. We cannot think of a
changing thing without thinking of something which is unchanging. Forms are finite. You cannot
think of a finite object without thinking of something beyond.(cid:148) This has similarity to the argument
for the existence of the infinite from the contingent nature of things. Further he adds: (cid:147)There is
beauty, intelligence, luminosity, law, order, harmony, in spite of apparent disorder and disharmony.
There must be an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent being who governs and controls this
vast universe(cid:148) (Ibid. pp. 188-89). The world has the character of an effect, which is observable from
the vicissitudes it constantly undergoes, and the effect always attempts to find rest in its cause. The
human mind feels itself constrained to carry the causal argument to its logical limits and posit at one
end of the series a cause of all things in the world of time, though it is itself outside all temporal
events. Every visible cause has another higher cause which is more pervasive and enduring. God is
the name we give to the highest cause. (cid:147)In this world of phenomena, there is a cause for everything.
The law of cause and effect operates. There is the cause, the father, for the effect which is the child.
There is the cause, the seed, for the effect which is the tree. There is the cause, the potter, for the
effect which is the pot.(cid:148) (cid:147)You see this world. There must be a cause for this world, which is an
effect. That causeless cause is God or the creator(cid:148) (Ibid. p. 189).

Udayana, the great Naiyayika, offers the following orthodox proofs for the existence of

God:

1. The world of perception is of the nature of an effect, and every effect must have a cause.
We have to infer the cause of the world, as the world has a tendency to reduce itself to its elements.
The composite parts get disintegrated and return to their causes, and the ultimate cause of all
composite substances should be one that is above all effected things. And this cause must have a
direct knowledge of the material causes of the world. Such an intelligent being must be God.

2. The conjunction of the causal elements into effects requires an intelligent operator. The
combination of atoms into groups at the time of creation cannot but be the work of a purposive
conscious being. The atoms do not combine pell-mell or at random. There is to be seen the hand of a
wise organiser behind the systematic grouping of the ultimate atoms into dyads and molecules. That
final organiser is God.

3. We observe that the things of the universe are well-supported; its parts, like the planets
etc., are held together, so that they do not collapse. The holder of such different parts in balance, to
constitute a system, must be God Himself, for nothing that is in the universe can support the
universe.

4. The world is observed to dissolve itself into subtler causes. The dissolution of the effect
into its cause means that there is a source into which the effect returns. The ultimate source of the
universe, then, should be beyond the universe, and it is God.

5. No knowledge can come to us of the different things here, unless there is a source of this
knowledge. The origin of all knowledge should be omniscient, and, consequently, omnipotent.
Such a being is not to be seen in this universe, and so it must be outside it. This being is God.

45

GOD EXISTS

6. The Vedas are held to be valid and authoritative from time immemorial. Such
authoritativeness of the Vedas as true and valid knowledge cannot be without an author behind
them, who ought to be an all-knower. This all-knower is God.

7. The Vedas cannot have any human author, because they deal with truths which no human
being knows. Hence the author of the Vedas ought to be a superhuman being, and this being is God.

8. A sentence, as it is known to us in the world, has a composer who joins the words together
and frames it. In like manner, the sentences of the Vedas consisting of words should have a
composer, and he cannot be anyone else than God.

9. The size of a dyad or a molecule depends on the number of the atoms that go to constitute
it. This requisite number of the atoms that go to form a particular compound could not have been
originally the object of the perception of any human being; so its contemplator must be God.

The Naiyayikas also add that the fruit of an individual(cid:146)s actions does not always lie within
the reach of the individual who is the agent. There ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of
actions, and this supreme dispenser is God.

The Yoga system of Patanjali considers God as the unsurpassed seed of omniscience. The
possibility of the omniscience and the necessity to admit a source for it leads to the positing of a
supreme Being who is unaffected by the changes characterised by affliction, action, fruition and the
tendencies in keeping with such fruition. The knowledge which the different individuals are
endowed with in this world is not of the same degree; there are grades in the manifestation of
knowledge. There is an ascending degree of knowledge, power and happiness in accordance with
the extent of the inclusiveness of the contents of knowledge. The greater the extent of the contents,
the wider is the knowledge. The various degrees of knowledge in the world suggest a maximum
ideal of knowledge, a state of omniscience which ought to be identified with eternal existence. Now
this state of omniscience that is compatible with eternity cannot be found in any limited individual,
for none here is seen to be all-wise. An omniscient being cannot be any individual, and he can be no
other than God. God enjoys the highest perfection, being endowed with the greatest magnitude of
knowledge and power. He alone can be omnipotent and be the Universal King.

The Nasadiya-Sukta of the Rig-Veda proclaims that at the beginning of things there was
Tamas, darkness pervading everywhere, and in the midst of this universal darkness the Light of the
One shone, all by itself. This glorious Intelligence is to be identified with the Self-born,
Svayambhu, having no cause outside it. This Self-born emerged from the primordial Tamas, by
means of its Tapas of untarnished knowledge, and projected this variegated world of individuals.
(cid:147)Darkness there was; in the beginning all this was a sea without light; the germ that lay covered by
the husk, that One was born by the power of Tapas(cid:148) (Rig-Veda, X. 129). The Rig-Veda extols the
Hiranyagarbha as the first God of beings. (cid:147)Hiranyagarbha was present in the beginning; when born,
he was the sole lord of created beings; he upheld this earth and heaven,-to which God we offer
worship with oblation. (To Him) who is the giver of soul-force, the giver of strength, who is
contemplated by everything, whom even the gods obey, whose shadow is immortality as well as
death,-to which God we offer worship with oblation(cid:148) (X. 121). (cid:147)With eyes everywhere, with faces
everywhere, with hands everywhere, with feet everywhere, He traverses with His arms and with

46

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

His swift-moving (feet), and exists as the One God, generating heaven and earth(cid:148) (X. 81). (cid:147)He who
is our parent, the creator, the ordainer, who knows our abodes and all beings, who is the name-giver
to the gods,-He is One; Him other beings come to inquire(cid:148) (X. 82). The Purusha-Sukta refers to the
great Lord as encompassing everything. (cid:147)Thousand-headed was the Purusha, thousand-eyed and
thousand-legged. He, covering the earth on all sides, stretched Himself beyond it by ten fingers(cid:146)
length. All this is the Purusha alone, whatever was and whatever shall be...... One-fourth of Him all
beings are, three-fourth of Him is immortal in the heaven(cid:148) (X. 90). The Absolute itself appears as
Isvara. (cid:147)From Him Virat was born, and from Virat, again, Purusha.(cid:148) Isvara is the body as well is the
soul of the world.

Following this great theme of the Veda, Manu, at the commencement of his code of law,
states: (cid:147)In the beginning all this was covered over by darkness, unknowable, indefinable,
unarguable, indeterminable; the universe appeared to be in a state of sleep, as it were. Then, the
Self-originated Divine Being, Himself unmanifested, manifested this universe with its great
elements etc., by tearing the veil of this darkness and revealing the forms of His creative energy. He,
who is not to be beheld by the senses, who is subtle, the unmanifest, the everlasting, the
unthinkable, the very embodiment of all beings,-He, of Himself, rose above this primordial
darkness(cid:148) (Manu-Smrit, I. 5-7). The Srimad Bhagavata records the spirit of this doctrine in the
words of the Lord Himself- (cid:147)I alone was in the beginning of things, the one beyond the manifest as
well as the unmanifest, and there was nothing else. And I alone shall be at the end ofthings. I alone
am all this that is manifest; and whatever remains other than this, that also is I Myself alone(cid:148) (II. ix.
32). The Lord speaks in the Bhagavad Gita: (cid:147)I am the Vedic rite, I the sacrifice, I the food offered to
the manes, I am the herbs and the medicines, I am the sacred formula and the hymn; I am the
clarified butter (offered in sacrifices); I am the consecrated fire, I the oblation. I am the Father of
this world, the Mother, Supporter, the Grandfather; I am the object to be known, I the purifier (of all
things), the syllable OM, and also the sacred lore of the Rik, the Sama and the Yajus; the Goal, the
Sustainer, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge, the Friend, the Origin, the Dissolution, the
Basis, the Storehouse, the Imperishable Seed. I give heat, I sent forth rain, and also withhold it; I am
immortality and also death; I am being and also non-being, O Arjuna!(cid:148) (IX. 16-19). Isvara is
described in the Gita as having manifested Himself here as the all-destroying Time.

The Limitations Of Reason

The true nature of God and His creation cannot be intellectually comprehended, for logic is
a proud child of the dualist prejudice. If God alone is all this world, the relation between Him and
the world no mortal can hope to know. Man(cid:146)s idea of God is highly defective, for God, as man
understands Him, is relative to the appearance of the world. God is a pure subject opposed to a
world of creation set before Him as an object cannot be absolute; and if He is not thus opposed, He
ceases to have any external relation to the world. If God is a universal consciousness having the
universe as His object, He cannot be connected with it except by a spatio-temporal knowledge.
Such a knowing process, however, is inadmissible in the case of God, for He is said to be untouched
by the vitiating divisions of space and time. But without this division, God cannot be distinguished
from the Absolute which will not brook any objectivation of itself. The gulf between the infinite
Purusha of the Sankhya and the Prakriti which vies with the former in almost every respect is an
instance of the defeat which the human intellect has to suffer when it attempts to visualise a reality
which is non-mediately related to the universe and yet is not the same as the universe. The God who

47

GOD EXISTS

is in man(cid:146)s mind cannot be freed from the difficulty of having to melt down to undifferentiated
being when His relation to the world is closely examined. Isvara(cid:146)s existence happens to be relative
to the demands of His self-manifesting work. He is, as long as the universe is.

Further, we cannot say that God created the world at any period of time. If the creative act is
not in time, it being the condition even of time, there would be no creation of a temporal world.
Creation is a process, and all process is in time. There is no process that can be dovetailed with
eternity. To cause anything, God may have to descend into time, and a descent into time is a descent
into finitude, change and a veritable self-destruction. If God is to bear any relation to phenomena,
He has to shed His eternal nature first. But somehow He creates and sustains the world without
losing His eternality. This the human intellect cannot understand. The Absolute sports in the
relative. The individuals of
the world arise as appearances participating in a relative
interdependence of existence and nature. If there is no child, there is no parent, too. Isvara becomes
an object of the notion of the Jiva, and a subject with the world as a predicate attached to it.

The logical character of truth and reality attributed to Isvara does not look consistent with
our ascribing to Him the ethical character of goodness, the aesthetic character of beauty and the
religious character of grace, all which carry an individualistic purport. If Isvara is the all, such
values turn to be different from what they mean to us here in this world. And why has Isvara created
the world? It cannot be for His satisfaction, for He has no wish or desire to fulfil. It cannot be with a
view to dispensing justice or showing mercy to others, for there are no others, as all beings are
subsequent to the creative act. It cannot be a play of Isvara, for play is normally supposed to be the
result of a need felt within to direct outside the excess of energy in the psycho-physical organism, to
overcome fatigue or boredom, or to replenish the system with fresh energy after an exhausting
work. Isvara can have no such needs, for He is not an individual organism. If Isvara is only a witness
of the sports of Prakriti which moves and acts at the inspiration received from His mere existence,
He would have a determining element outside Him, which would prevent Him from being an
absolute monarch. Isvara is Brahman envisaged by our experiential conditions in relation to a world
of change. The question of creation is restricted to the world of the senses and the intellect, and the
answer to it cannot but be empirically bound. There cannot be a correct answer to an erroneous
question. That the world is, is a belief of ours, and the whole problem of creation hinges on how we
react to our environment as dismembered bodies in a cosmic society.

The futility of the logical methods in determining the nature of Isvara does not imply,
however, that there is no Intelligence underlying the world and influencing it throughout. For a
denial of such a being would entail a denial of the world, and, consequently, our own selves as
individuals. Certain inherent defects in our faculties of knowing prevent us from comprehending
transcendent truths in a proper manner. It does not follow that the invisible is always non-existent.
If we are, the world is; and if the world is, Isvara also is. If Isvara is not, the world also is not; and we
as individuals, too, cannot be. There is reciprocal dependence of the existence of these three
principles always. Our concepts are relative; the absolutely real is only Brahman. But as long as we
accept our own existence as diversified elements in a world, a sovereign being giving meaning to
life cannot be doubted. Our own conscious powers within us urge us to accept that Isvara must be.
The scriptures corroborate our inner spiritual aspirations and extol an Isvara who is the creator of
this world. Swami Sivananda countenances the Lila theory of creation, not with a view to offering it
as any final explanation of the world, but to bringing out the idea that the creative act of Isvara is

48

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

free from any taint of selfishness or ulterior motive, and to suggest that it is beyond the
purview of the human mind. It is the nature of Isvara to create, to manifest and unfold the world;
there is no other reason for it that is humanly conceivable. To show that Isvara has no personal
interest whatsoever, it is also added that He only helps creation, which is really a manifestation or
expression of the dormant potencies of the individuals who, not being liberated at the end of the
previous cycle, existed in a latent form during the dissolution of the universe after that cycle. Rain
may help the growth of a plant, but the nature of the plant depends on the seed from which it grows.
The sun may help the activities of the world, but he remains unaffected by the results of such
activities.

The theory of the creation of the world by Isvara is not to be taken as any statement of
ultimate fact, but is meant to serve as a working hypothesis introduced to bring out the idea of the
non-difference of the world from Brahman. Srishti or creation, and Pravesa or the entrance of Isvara
into the world in His immanence, are Arthavadas or eulogical concepts intended to bring home to
the mind of man the fact of the secondlessness of Brahman and the total dependence of the world on
Brahman. No explanation of the why or the how of creation, and no concept of Isvara as the
supreme Ruler of the world, can be finally satisfactory, for such statements and concepts are based
on a false faith in the individuality of the self and the variety of the world of experience. But they are
serviceable as a modus operandi in directing the individual from his ignorant prejudices of a bodily
existence to the splendour of
Isvara is sometimes said to be supreme
Self-consciousness. But
the Self-conscious Brahman would require something as an
other-than-itself, at least space, to make such a condition possible. Brahman does not stand in need
of knowing itself either as a subject or an object. But it has somehow to be related to the world. The
result is Isvara. How such a relation is possible, the intellect is not fortunate enough to know. It calls
this mystery (cid:145)Maya(cid:146).

the Absolute.

The Inner Ruler And Controller

The nature of Isvara as portrayed by Swami Sivananda in his Philosophy and Teachings
(pp. 107-12) can be presented as follows: If we look at reality from the practical point of view or
Vyavaharika-Drishti, Isvara may be regarded as the cause, the creator, sustainer and destroyer of
the world, and therefore as an omnipotent and omniscient being. Reality here appears to be
possessed of all qualities, is conceived to be Saguna, and in this aspect it is called Isvara. Swami
Sivananda does not appear to make in his writings the usual technical distinction between Saguna
Brahman and Isvara, as emphasised in certain texts of the Vedanta. Isvara becomes the object of the
adoration of pious devotees. He is endowed with all the good and glorious attributes that one can
think of as raised to the degree of infinity. The Saguna-Brahman and the Nirguna-Brahman are not
two Brahmans, but one and the same reality looked at from two different standpoints, the lower or
the Vyavaharika and the higher or the Paramarthika. Isvara is Sarvajna or all-knowing, and is the
source of all powers. He is the Soul of all Nature, the animating breath of all beings. He is the cause
from which appears the origin, the sustenance and the dissolution of the world. Brahman conceived
as Cause is Isvara. He is above all evils and is the immanent Spirit or the Antaryamin pervading,
maintaining and vibrating the whole universe as its very Self.

The Nirguna-Brahman is not the antithesis of Sarguna-Brahman, but is the essence of the
latter. Saguna-Brahman or Isvara is the material cause as well is the efficient cause of all things,

49

GOD EXISTS

associated differently with Tamas and Sattva. Brahman does not change itself into the universe, but
the latter emerges from Isvara and exists in Him. Isvara becomes the Cause through His inscrutable
power of self-expression. It is the principle of cosmic appearance that hides the real and manifests
the unreal. By means of it Isvaratva is falsely superimposed on Brahman. But this superimposition
is real to the Jivas, and so Isvara also is real to them. As the Jiva understands Him, Isvara is
unproduced, has no cause, and is no effect. He Himself is the first Cause without any other origin.
The Nirguna-Brahman becomes a personal God when it is viewed from the point of view of the
universe. Isvara is consciousness defined by Maya (Maya-Visishtha-Chaitanya). Referring to the
Antaryami-Brahmana of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Swami Sivananda writes: (cid:147)The Internal
Ruler must be Brahman or the Supreme Self. Why so? Because His qualities are mentioned in the
passage under discussion. Brahman is the cause of all created things. Universal Rulership is an
appropriate attribute of the Supreme Self only. Omnipotence, Selfhood, immortality, etc. can be
ascribed only to Brahman. The passage, (cid:145)He whom the earth does not know(cid:146), etc., shows that the
Inner Ruler is not known by the earth-deity. Therefore, it is obvious that the Inner Ruler is different
from that deity. The attributes (cid:145)unseen,(cid:146) (cid:145)unheard,(cid:146) etc., also, refer to the Supreme Self only, which
destitute of shape and other sensible qualities. He is also is described in the section as being
all-pervading, as He is inside and is the Ruler within of everything, viz., the earth, the sun, water,
fire, sky, ether, the senses, etc. This also can be true only of the highest Self or Brahman. For all the
reasons, the Inner Ruler is no other than the Supreme Self or Brahman(cid:148) (Brahmasutras, Vol. I, p.
110). Here the Supreme Self or Brahman refers to the Absolute regarded as the Lord of the
universe,-Isvara.

(cid:147)God is Truth. God is Love. God is the Light of lights. God is Knowledge. God is the
embodiment of Bliss. God is Eternity. God is Immortality. God is Infinity.(cid:148) (cid:147)That secondless
Supreme Being, who resides in the chambers of your heart as the Inner Ruler or Controller, who has
no beginning, middle or end, is God or Atman, or Brahman or Purusha or Chaitanya or Bhagavan or
Purushottama.(cid:148) (cid:147)Nitya-Sukha (eternal bliss), Parama-Santi (supreme peace), Nitya-Tripti (eternal
satisfaction), Akhanda-Sukha (unbroken joy), and infinite happiness can be had only in God.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Srishti (creation), Sthiti (preservation), Samhara (destruction), Tirodhana (veiling) and Anugraha
(blessing) are the five kinds of action (Pancha-kriya) of God.(cid:148) (cid:147)Bhagavan is a term synonymous
with God. He who has the six attributes of Jnana (wisdom), Vairagya (dispassion), Yasas (fame),
Aisvarya (divine powers), Sri (wealth) and Dharma (righteousness) in their fullest measure, is
Bhagavan.(cid:148) (cid:147)Sarvajnatva (omniscience), Sarvesvaratva (supreme rulership), Sarvantaryamitva
(inner control over all), Sarvakaranatva (causality in the creation, preservation and destruction of
everything), Sarvaniyantritva (ability to bring restraint over all), Sarvakartritva (makership of all
things), Sarvasaktimattva (omnipotence), Svatantratva (absolute independence) are the seven
attributes of God(cid:148) (Mind and Its Mysteries, pp. 163-64). Isvara does not occupy any region of
space, for there is no Loka or world for Isvara. Siva has Kailasaloka, Brahma has Brahmaloka and
Vishnu has Vaikunthaloka. But Isvara, Hiranyagarbha and Virat, as manifestations of Brahman,
transcend all planes of existence, while including everything within them.

The apparent differences that we observe in the world among the ways in which the
individuals are made to experience pleasure and pain are not to be attributed to Isvara as their Inner
Ruler but to the Karmas of the individuals themselves. Injustice and cruelty cannot at any time be
imputed to the universal Lord, who is the same to all beings. God, in the process of the dispensation
of justice, takes into consideration the nature of the actions done by the different individuals in their

50

ISVARA OR THE UNIVERSAL SOUL

previous births. The circumstances in which God places individuals are suited to the nature of their
deserts. God is not, strictly speaking, any arbitrary creator of the world but the primary principle
responsible and necessary for the expression of an environment fitted to the manner in which the
Karmas of the individuals have to fructify themselves in various ways. The life of an individual is
determined, therefore, not by any caprice on the part of Isvara, but by its past deeds,-good, bad or
mixed. The question of a first creation of the world by Isvara, where no individuals could have
existed to account for the nature of the world to be manifested, cannot arise, for there is no such
thing as first creation. The factor of time cannot be set prior to creation. Creation is just an
appearance, and when objectively viewed, it can have neither a beginning nor an end. Creation,
when it is correctly understood, is not a temporal act or a fiat of the will of any person, but an
interrelated appearance in which the observer or the questioner has no right to consider all things
except himself as an object to be known and himself as a subject of knowledge. This is the defect of
all scientific methods of approach. Empirically viewed, every form of existence has a previous
existence, so that manifestation is beginningless. Such an infinite regress is inevitable when the
temporal intellect attempts to comprehend Eternity. How appearance is related to reality, the logical
intellect cannot know; and when it tries to know that, it is landed in fallacies and absurdities.

The work of creation by Isvara is to be considered His supreme Yoga. His acts receive their
significance not through any outward implement but by the self-manifestation of Himself by the
immense powers that He possesses. Isvara does not need any instrument to project this universe, for
it is in Himself. His Tapas or creative contemplation consists in the concentration of His
omniscience, and His power is identical with His knowing and being. Though the limitations of the
intellect compel us to conceive of Isvara as a personal God, he should not be compared to the human
personality in any way. It is because one cannot say that Isvara creates the world by any outward
compulsion or necessity that most philosophers are obliged to view creation as a Lila or sport. Even
the Karmas of individuals cannot be any compelling factor forcing Isvara to create the world. His
existence is a wonder, His ways are a mystery. Isvara has no desires, but without His primal wish
the world cannot be explained. This wish, again, is not directed to the achievement of any purpose
that is expected to bring Him personal satisfaction, for a cosmic being can have no motive,
whatsoever. No sense of incompleteness on the part of Isvara can be said to be the cause of the rise
of His Will to create. Creation is His nature. God Himself is the universe.

Isvara possesses an innate intuition which grasps all things at once. He can have no
prejudices, no presuppositions, no attachments and no aversions, for He has nothing outside
Himself. Isvara, in the beginning, sends forth His humanly indeterminable Will to create, in order to
provide a field for the working out of the unfructified Karmas of unliberated individuals, who,
during the previous dissolution of the universe, were withdrawn into the primordial condition of
Prakriti. The Will of Isvara to manifest phenomena sets the whole existence in vibration, and the
unfulfilled potencies of the Karmas of individuals are set in motion, and these activated potencies
attract towards their centres particles of matter that gravitate to form bodies in the manner required
by each group of potencies. These bodies are the Bhogayatanas, receptacles for the enjoyment of
pleasure and pain. One(cid:146)s body, senses, vital energy, mind, intellect, pleasure, pain, etc., are all
determined by these forces of Karma. Isvara is the cosmic Director of this whole scheme; without
His energy and will, no motion whatsoever is possible. Primary creation is the work of Isvara, and it
begins with the rise of His Will and ends with the act of His entering into the bodies of all beings and
animating their minds and intellects. There is also a secondary creation which is carried on by the

51

GOD EXISTS

individual, after the work of Isvara becomes complete, and this consists in the activity of
experiencing the diverse conditions determining the states of waking, dream, sleep and the
attainment of final liberation. In Isvara(cid:146)s creation there is freedom, while bondage is always implied
in the projection of the individual.

is called Maya when we take into account

In his Jnana-Yoga, Swami Sivananda confirms the following view: The primitive principle
of appearance, which is essentially one,
the
predominance of its projecting power, and is called Avidya when we take into consideration the
predominance of its enveloping power. Thus the objective principle, of which the projecting power
is superior to the concealing power, is the limiting condition of Isvara; and the same principle with
its concealing power predominant is the limiting condition of the Jiva (the individual). The Avidya
which forms the limiting adjunct of the Jiva is otherwise called Ajnana. That the projecting power is
predominant in Isvara follows from His being the creator of this great universe. He is always
conscious of His free state, and hence is untouched by the concealing power. The Jiva, on the
contrary, labours under the ignorance of its true nature, owing to the predominance of the
concealing power and the absence of the projecting power, and feels incompetent to create the
universe, as Isvara does (p. 98). Here the projecting power referred to is the cosmic power of Isvara
and not the individualistic force of distraction which makes one perceive diversity of things. When
the Jiva sheds its cramping individuality, it finds itself in an experience of the majestic Unity of
beings.

THE WORLD OF SCIENCE

Sri Swami Krishnananda

The effect, in the end, of the process of knowledge which posits an external world, is, that,
for all practical purposes, the world and the individual are independent entities, a position that is
affirmed by sense-perception and corroborated by a judgment of the mind. To live in a world which
is not vitally connected with oneself may involve a curious moment-to-moment adjustment to suit
the moods and the vagaries of the world, which has its seasons, its winds and storms, its rains and
droughts, its quakes and tornadoes rising from the sea which covers the whole earth as a belt, and
several other inscrutable behaviours of Nature, with which the individual has to put up, somehow.
The insecurity consequent upon having to live in a world standing outside the knowledge and
capacity of the individual keeps everyone restless, wonderstruck and curious as to how the physical
world behaves in the manner it does. What is it that motivates the changes in Nature, the precise
movements of the solar and stellar systems, the wide galaxies and the endless space with an endless
time attached to it? Here comes the effort of the individual to make a scientifically calculated study
of Nature and its ways.

Commonsense has it that the world is just a large mass of earth-stuff with water, air and heat
as well as light coming from the sun. Originally, it was thought that the earth was flat and the sun
moved round it in a circular fashion. If the earth had been really flat like a pancake, the rise of the

52

THE WORLD OF SCIENCE

sun at one end of the world would have illumined the entire world in one instant. But, the sun does
not illumine the earth that way. The fact that the mornings and the noons and the evenings of some
part of the world need not be such to certain other parts of the world, would be enough to tell us that
the earth is perhaps round in its shape and is not flat. Ancient astronomers in India like Aryabhata
and Copernicus in the West maintained that the sun does not go round the earth, but that it is the
earth that goes round the sun. Indications to this effect can be found even in the mass of literature
known as the Vedas with their Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads.

Even advanced scientists like Newton held the view that space is like a vast receptacle in
which the entire material world is contained, with no living connection between the content and the
container. Objects in the world were considered to attract each other with a pull known as
gravitation with reference to their mass and distance. It took a long time to discover through the
further history of science that the material world is not just contained in space as in a cup but there is
an inseparable relation between matter on one hand and space and time on the other. It was observed
that space and the world of earth, water, fire and air are internally related and the whole thing
constitutes an endless electromagnetic force, as it were, with more or less pressure in different parts
of this field which has its undulations like waves, causing concentration of substance in different
areas, gradually concretising itself as gas, heat, liquid and solid. We may notice here, perhaps, the
first step in the world of science to visualise a universal continuum, man himself not standing
outside it but included in it, thus the entire Nature being a self-contained whole.

Also, matter was originally said to be constituted of minute particles called molecules
which are chemical in their nature, differing from one another because of their chemical
composition. Researchers held that the molecules are made up of a minuter body of stuff called
atoms, which, in turn, were noticed to be tiny centres of force rather than things in themselves,
gyrating with velocity, with a nucleus within and wavelike particles moving around, known as
electrons. The solar system with the sun in the centre and the planets revolving round the sun can be
compared to the structure of the atom, wherein the sun would be the nucleus of this larger (cid:145)atom(cid:146) of
the solar system and the planets would be in the position of electrons, thereby indicating, again, that
even the bodies of planets may not be the large bundles of heavy material as they appear to ordinary
perception, but are immensely large packets of force concentrated in varying extensions of the
pressure of force. This sub-atomic substance became the object of more and more concentrated
investigations as to its true nature. The quantum theory of physics proclaimed that matter is a series
of wave patterns or particles of light which behave like waves, and matter is convertible into light
and energy. It may be that light and energy, too, can be converted into matter as it seems to have
happened when gases became liquids and liquids became solid substances with heat involved in the
process of motion and friction. The world stood before the scientist as a gigantic miracle of power
and radiance, rather than as a stuff looking like dead matter and unintelligent crudity.

It is the Theory of Relativity that actually shook the world of science from its very roots,
which, while it accepted that matter and energy are interconvertible (E = mc2), rose up to the
necessity to investigate the very structure of Space and Time in its relation to Gravitation. The
Relativity position is difficult to explain in a few words, but suffice it to say that it discovered that
Space is not like a sheet spread out in a three-dimensional fashion, and Time is not just linear
motion. Space and Time go together to constitute what may be called Space-Time and form a
four-dimensional continuum, very uncomfortably breaking down all the rules, laws and regulations

53

GOD EXISTS

of the three-dimensional world of common perception. Even the Space-Time continuum should not
be regarded as a substance somewhat like a tangible something. Rather, the Space-Time of
Relativity is a conceptual field of mathematical point-events, reducing staggeringly the whole
world to the nature of a universal mind-stuff. (cid:147)The stuff of the world is consciousness,(cid:148) said Arthur
Eddington, and (cid:147)God is a cosmic mathematical Thought,(cid:148) said James Jeans. We have gone too far
from the rural conception of a farmer(cid:146)s field of harvest and plantation to the field of universal
relativity, which looks more like God thinking His own Thought, rather than anything else, if we
could be permitted to employ this phrase which we cannot avoid one day or the other.

The interconnectedness of phenomena in the so-called events of the world taking place not
in Space or in Time, but in a four-dimensional Space-Time continuum, was taken up with its more
advanced implications for consideration by Alfred North Whitehead. In his philosophy of the
(cid:145)Organism(cid:146), Whitehead arrived at the conclusion that there are no set causes producing set effects,
but anything can be an effect or a cause in a symmetrical manner of action and reaction, since the
world as it is discovered by the Theory of Relativity is an organism with its parts integrally related
to it. Cause and effect are continuous, the absence of which continuity would sever any possible
relation between cause and effect. Things in the world are called (cid:145)actual occasions(cid:146), the potential
concentrated points of force whose very existence as well as structure are conditioned by the
existence and structure of other (cid:145)actual occasions(cid:146) which fill the cosmos as its constituents. The
world is not a solid substance but is more like a field of law and order, an idea of total inclusiveness,
a system of internal give-and-take policy obtaining among the individualities known as (cid:145)actual
occasions(cid:146),
transforming the location of individuals into a fluid movement of a liquefied
connection, as it were, with everything else also in the world. Super-individual intentions, known as
(cid:145)eternal objects(cid:146), in the language of Whitehead, like the (cid:145)Ideas(cid:146) of Plato, (cid:145)ingress(cid:146) into the body of
the (cid:145)actual occasions(cid:146) and make them appear to be what they are. Even the God of religion,
according to Whitehead, exists as a determining factor of the determination of (cid:145)actual occasions(cid:146) by
the (cid:145)eternal objects(cid:146), and He Himself stands, therefore, determined in a way by the prehensive and
apprehensive activities of the (cid:145)actual occasions(cid:146), thus bringing about a mutual action and reaction
process between God and the individuals. The far-reaching thought of Whitehead would not forbid
the conclusion that God has, at the same time, to be transcendent to the world of the (cid:145)actual
occasions(cid:146), though they are there just because He Himself is.

The specially religious import of modern physical science is highlighted also in the system
of Samuel Alexander, which he purports to explain in his book entitled (cid:147)Space, Time and Deity(cid:148).
According to Alexander, Space-Time is the matrix of all things, the very substance of the universe,
a clue that he gathers from the Theory of Relativity. The Space-Time matrix causes motion and
force, and brings about the three-dimensional picture of what are known as primary qualities, like
length, breadth and height, substance, volume and content. The perception of these primary
qualities happens to be through the secondary qualities arising as a sort of action-reaction process
obtaining between the object of perception, namely, a primary quality, and the perceiving mind. To
cite an instance, a leaf looks green in colour not because there is such a thing called greenness in
Nature itself, but because of an abstraction of properties automatically taking place in the internal
structure of the leaf excluding all other characteristics in Nature apart from what looks like green.
So is the case with other colours and forms of objects. Sensations of every kind form, again, a set of
secondary qualities, that is to say, no one can know what the world is in itself as a set of primary
qualities. Mind, intellect and reason are the further manifestations or evolutes of the Space-Time

54

THE WORLD OF SCIENCE

continuum or matrix, which point to the manifestation of a controlling principle called Deity, and
every succeeding stage can be regarded as a Deity to the preceding stage. According to Alexander,
the final Deity is yet to be manifested completely, which, when achieved, will be the end of the
cosmic process. Perhaps, here, Alexander intends to say, which he actually does not, that the end of
the cosmic process of evolution is the attainment of God. Also, a God who is yet to be will not have
the character of eternity, and God, then, would cease to be God.

RELIGION AND SCIENCE (I)

Sri Swami Sivananda

Yoga and Science are inseparable. Science and Religion are inseparable. Science is part of
Religion. Science and Religion are necessary correlatives. Scientists are also monists in one sense.
They also emphatically declare that there is only one thing viz., Matter or Energy. A Yogi tries to
control the mental forces,a scientist the physical forces. This is all the difference between a Yogi
and a scientist. A scientist is also an unconscious Raja-Yogi, but his mind works in external
grooves.

Before the invention of watch, Yogius used to calculate time by measuring the shadow in
day and by the study of the movement of the stars in the heavens at night. They were perfectly exact
in their calculations. Astronomy and medicine received their first impulse from the exigencies of
religious worship. Yogins have a sound practical knowledge of Ayurveda. One who endeavours to
qualify himself as his own doctor can become a Yogi. He has to live sometimes in the jungles and
has to treathimself first, whenever diseases manifest. Otherwise his Sadhana will suffer and he
cannot have rapid progress in Yoga. You will find in the books on Ayurveda: (cid:147)A healthy body is a
good instrument for doing virtuous actions and practising Yoga.(cid:148) Those who wrote these
Ayurvedic books were great Rishis and Yogins.

investigates,

Science is partially unified knowledge. A scientist observes the laws of Nature,
experiements in his laboratory,
infers and draws exact conclusions from his
observations. He understands Nature. But he knows nothing of the origin or destiny of Nature! Who
made the sun and gave power to its rays? Who combined four parts of nitrogen with one part of
oxygen? Who gave power to electrons? Who gave power to atoms to combine into molecules? Who
or what made and bestowed upon the ultimate particles of matter their marvellous power of varied
interaction? Science does not know this great mystery. On the contrary, Yoga is completely unified
knowledge. A Yogi gets inner divine realisation. He clearly sees with his inner Yogic eyes the
subtle rudiments of matter. He identifies himself with the Supreme Being who is the Lord of the
Prakriti (matter). He gets control over the five elements. He clearly understands the whole mystery
of creation through direct intuitional knowledge. The scientist lacks this sort of knowledge. He has
only experimental knowledge.

55

GOD EXISTS

In the matter of evidence in psychological question, the sense-perceptions with which
science naturally deals are only second-rate criteria and therefore to be received with caution. The
closing of the external channels of sensation is usually the signal for the opening of the psychic, and
from all evidence it would seem that the psychic sense is more extensive, acute and in every way
more dependable than the physical.

The business of science is generalisation of phenomena; it is the function of philosophy and
Yoga to explain. Religion is the practical aspect of philosophy. Philosophy is the rational aspect of
religion. The scientist tries to answer the (cid:147)How(cid:148) of the problem; the philosopher and the Yogi the
(cid:147)Why(cid:148) of it. It is a mistake to say that such and such an event occurs because of certain laws of
Nature. The laws of Nature do not give any real explanation of the phenomena. It is simply a
statement in terms as general as possible of what happens under given circumstances in his
expression of an observed order or uniformity in a natural phenomena. Science is concerned only
with the phenomena. It shows a marvellous harmony of Nature. But it is the problem of philosophy
and Yoga to solve the (cid:147)Why(cid:148) of Nature(cid:146)s harmony. Scientists possess partial knowledge of the
universe. They have not understood the whole code of Nature(cid:146)s laws. They have no knowledge of
the occult side of things. They have no knowledge of the astral, mental and higher planes such as
Brahma-Loka (world of Brahma). The unseen world is of far greater importance than the
sense-universe which is visible to the naked eye. A fully developed Yogi can function in all the
planes and so he has full knowledge of the manifested and unmanifested Nature. The senses by
which you get knowledge of the external objects are not fully developed. Therefore the knowledge
obtained is partial. The external senses are exact counterparts of the internal astral senses. Scientists
have no knowledge of the subtle rudiments of matter. Life will become fuller and richer, when one
develops this inner eye-sight by the practice of Yoga. Just as blood, when seen under the
microscope, reveals many mysterious things such as leucocytes, lymphocytes, nuclei, pigment,
germs, bacilli, etc., so also the inner Yogic eye reveals many mysteries of the hidden side of things.
The knowledge of the scientists is only fragmentary or partial whereas the knowledge of the Yogi is
full and perfect.

Science differs radically in its outlook from philosophical musings. Consequently the mode
of approach to its specific problems is different from that of philosophy. Yet there is some similarity
in their findings, when some broad questions are discussed.

Scientists have to learn many things from the Seers of the East. Who gave power to the
electrons to revolve? Who gave life to the cell or the protoplasm? What is that power that unites
atoms to form molecules? Who gave intelligence to the cells to secrete milk or bile or gastric juice
from the blood? Scientists are still observing and experimenting. They are still groping in darkness.
What is the cause of the origin of an impulse? Who is the director of the mind? What is the cause of
the origin of thought? Even if all the living scientists were to put their heads together to solve these
questions, they cannot give definite conclusive answers.

English-educated people are unduly carried away by scientific theories and discoveries.
Anything, however stupid it may be, when stamped by the seal of science, is regarded as gospel of
truth. A theory or doctrine, however fallacious it may be, is accepted as true wisdom for all ages,
when it is proclaimed in the name and on the authority of science. Even if some fantastic and
ludicrous statements are made with the stamp of science by a Haeckel, Einstein or Tyndel, people

56

RELIGION AND SCIENCE (I)

are quite ready to swallow it with great avidity. Such is the fashion of the day! They reject as base
superstition the sublime teachings of the ancient Rishis and Sages. The brains of these so-called
educated and cultured people need a prompt, drastic and thorough flushing for a protracted length
of time. The poison has percolated into their very cells and tissues.

But I do not mean to condemn the wonderful discoveries and inventions that modern
science has contributed to the vast store of knowledge and happiness which the present generation
enjoys today. The radio, the aeroplane, the microphone and other marvels of science are bound to
baffle human intelligence. Scientists have found ways to fertilize an ovum with chemicals, without
the help of semen. It is stupendous success. Some children are also born. They inject the semen that
is obtained from renowned and cultured men of the world in order to improve the race. They are
attempting to fix a radio in a match-stick. They are trying to get the necessary nutrition to the body
by pressing an electric button, so that eating and defecation may be entirely abandoned. They are
endeavouring to make the streets move so that there will be no necessity for motor-cars and
carriages. They are trying to establish means of communication with the planet Mars. They may
succeed in all their attempts. May God bless them with roaring success in all their undertakings! But
the question is: Can all these comforts and scientific discoveries and inventions give immortality,
eternal satisfaction and everlasting peace? Have these material comforts enhanced human
happiness? Is not man more restless today than ever before? Is he not more dissatisfied and
discontented despite all these comforts? Life has become more complex and intricate. Luxuries are
increasing day by day. Even a rich man finds it difficult to make both ends meet. There is only one
remedy for all these ills. You will have to abandon all luxuries and go back to simple natural living,
if you want to enjoy real and lasting happiness. Immortality can be attained by realising the Self
through simple living, practice of Yoga, self-control, mental discipline and meditation.

Matter exists in different conditions or states viz., solid, liquid and gaseous. The conditions
may be made to change by variation of pressure and temperature. Water is turned into ice at a low
temperature and steam at a higher temperature. Every solid may become a liquid or gas under
suitable conditions; every liquid may be rendered solid or gaseous; every gas may be made liquid or
solid. One form of energy can be also transmuted into another form of energy. Heat can be
transmuted into light and light into electricity. Even so, seminal energy or muscular energy, anger,
etc., can be transmuted into spiritual energy (Ojas-Shakti).

There is life in the mineral kingdom. This has been conclusively proved by the experiments
of Prof. Von Schron at Naples. Even the elements manifest distinct preference. One element has a
strong liking for the company of another. One element may even give up the company of one
substance in order to join another element. This is chemical affinity. Every chemist fully knows this
well. Hydrogen likes the company of oxygen. Two molecules of hydrogen combine with one
molecule of oxygen. Water is formed. If you place sodium in the water, you will notice that oxygen
likes sodium better than hydrogen and immediately abandons the company of hydrogen and joins
sodium.

Likes and dislikes are more markedly present in the vegetable kingdom,than in the mineral.

Many plants exhibit a remarkable degree of ingenuity in accomplishing their ends.

GOD EXISTS

You should not think that the different planes or realms are lying one above another like the
trunks in a shop. The different planes fill up the same space and interpenetrate one another like the
light of a hurricane lamp, electric light, gas lamp and an ordinary kerosene chimney in a room.
Matter has different degrees of density and different planes are constituted according to the
different degrees of density of matter. These different planes are not separated in space. You are
surrounded by these planes. You can be in touch with these planes, if you develop the inner astral
eye or the clairvoyant sight. It is not necessary for you to travel in space to study the condition of
these planes. Within the space of the room you have the seven planes interpenetrating each other.
The beings of a higher plane cannot be seen by the beings of a lower plane. But a being of the higher
plane can see the beings of the lower plane.

According to the theory of Relativity some scientists believe that the world will expand
after some years and man of future generations will be seven inches tall only, because matter will
have to accommodate now to the increased size of the universe. Some matter is taken out of the
bodies of human beings and distributed elsewhere to adjust the state of affairs. This is only a
speculation and guesswork of some adventurous scientists. It may not happen at all. So you need
not be afraid in the least. Be bold and cheerful. Try to get liberation in this very birth so that there
will not be any chance for you to get a tiny body of the size mentioned above even if such an event
were to occur. One question strikes me very prominently: Can there be the police department then?
Can there be military and naval forces and world-wars? How can a tiny man wield a machine gun?
So there will be no world-wars. There will be perfect peace everywhere. Scientists will also have to
close down their laboratories. No more inventions and discoveries. No more radios and aeroplanes.
No more dictators and tyrants. No more Hitlers and Mussolinis. But Yogins there will always be.
Yogins can maintain their usual size. They can even expand their bodies ad infinitum through their
Mahima Siddhi. They can change their atoms and molecules and rearrange them. They can create
new minds, new bodies by their Yogic powers. Even during the Cosmic Deluge they can live. Yogi
Kaka Bhusunda lived during many deluges. The position of Yogins is always safe. Yoga is the
Supreme Divine Science. It is the Science of sciences. There will be more peace through simple
living. Let us pray to have that new happy era soon.

God is the greatest Mathematician. All scientists and astronomers are stunned. They bow
down their heads and say: (cid:147)We cannot proceed further. There is something beyond intellect. Our
knowledge is imperfect. The riddle of the universe can be solved only by knowledge of the Greatest
Mathematician through intuition. The intellect is a frail and finite instrument. The deductions from
various theories have not given us perfect illumination. We are still groping in darkness. We are
open to correction. Salutations and adoptions to that Greatest Mathematician! Salutations to the
Lord of the Universe! May He soon open our inner eyes of intuition!(cid:148)

He who dwells within this electron or atom, who is within this electron or atom, whose body
this electron or atom is, whom this electron or atom does not know, who rules the electron or atom
from within is thy Self, Inner Ruler, Immortal. It is this Science of Yoga that can help man to unfold
his latent divinity and realise his inner Self, the basis or source of this world, body, mind, electron,
atom and all sciences. Let us all pray to the Lord of the Universe and practise Yoga in right earnest
and commune with the Lord and obtain Immortality, Supreme Peace and Infinite Bliss!

Om Peace! Peace! Peace!

RELIGION AND SCIENCE (II)

Sri Swami Sivananda

Some scientists, and some so-called educated persons, believe that science can explain
everything and can solve the riddle of the universe and all problems of life. They also think that the
scientific method is the only method of finding out the truth, and that the scientific training and
discipline alone can very efficiently build the character of man. They have ignored ethical
discipline, morality and religion altogether, and given religion an inferior position.

One scientist came to me and said: (cid:147)The Upanishads and the Brahma-Sutras have not been
written scientifically. I am trying to give a scientific approach to this vital subject. (cid:147)I laughed and
said : (cid:147)My dear scientist-friend! The Upanishads are revelations. Brahma-vidya is transcendental.
The Atman is transcendental. You cannot take your test-tubes and spirit lamps near Him. The
scientists’ conclusions cannot approach His region. Their observations are one-sided, as they
concern the waking state alone. Their experiences are relative experiences.(cid:148) The scientist kept
quiet, put down his head in shame, and walked away quietly.

Three blind people touched the different parts of an elephant. One touched the foot, and
said: (cid:147)The elephant is like a pillar(cid:148). Another touched the ear, and said: (cid:147)The elephant is like a fan(cid:148).
A third touched the belly, and said: (cid:147)The elephant is like a pot(cid:148). Even so, a scientist explores the
physical plane, and speaks of atom, energy, and physical laws. He is also like a blind man. He has
knowledge of one dimension alone. He has ignored the dreaming and deep sleep states. He has no
all-comprehensive knowledge. A Vedantin alone has full knowledge of everything.

The Ease-Loving Nature Of Man

As life has been made physically comfortable and comparatively effortless by modern
inventions, the ease-loving man is prone to disregard the place of religion in his life and exalt the
values of materialistic civilization. But events have always disclosed the unreliability of the purely
objective views and methods of physical science, the experience of man that he is not really
happier, and the world is not in fact better, even after his arduous attempts at extracting out of
external nature its latent resources in order to utilize them for his own purposes. Where is
satisfaction, where is happiness, and where is peace then question

Some wise scientists are fully conscious now of the limitations of science, and of its
methods, in the investigation of phenomena in planes of subtler states of matter. The reality of the
spiritual world is closed book to them. They are equally conscious of the limitations of science in
the regeneration of unregenerate human nature, and in the attainment of the Supreme Good or
Eternal Bliss, the summum bonum of life.

What Has Science Done To Us?

Can scientific inventions make us really happy ? That is the question of questions now.

What has science done to us?

59

GOD EXISTS

Science has now removed time and space. You can go to London even within ten hours
(from India). What a great marvel ! This earth has become very, very small. But, has science really
contributed to human happiness ? The answer is an emphatic no, no. It has multiplied human wants
and luxuries. A luxury of today becomes a necessity of tomorrow. It has made man a beggar.

Science has invented many marvellous things. Scientists are labouring day and night in their
laboratories to invent many more things. But, science has made life very complex, and rendered
very keen the struggle for existence. It has increased the restlessness of the mind. It has not
contributed to the peace of man. Everybody admits this solid fact. The scientists have made
tremendous progress in the twentieth century. The atomic bombs can devastate a large country in
the twinkling of an eye. Radios, telephones, telepathy, television, aeroplanes without pilots, mines,
tanks, pocket radios, bombs in fountain-pens and cigarettes, underground palaces, shafts, V-bombs,
fighters, bombers, anti-aircraft guns, gas bombs, torpedoes, submarines are all astounding marvels.
But, the scientists have not improved the ethical condition of the people. They have not solved the
problem of unemployment, poverty, war, starvation, disunity among communities, nations, and
governments.

Science has analyzed man. He is supposed to be a creature composed of various physical
and chemical substances. Yet, no scientist has yet been able to assemble these constituent chemical
elements of a man’s body into one homogeneous creature which lives, talks, and acts like a man.

The scientist bombards the atoms, watches the movement of the electrons in his laboratory,
spends his whole life in understanding the nature and secret of matter and energy, invents many
things, studies the laws of nature; and yet, he is not able to comprehend the mystery of creation and
of the Creator, and the meaning of life.

Science Is Defective

Scientists are very, very busy in studying the external world. They have entirely forgotten to
study the internal world. Science gives you knowledge only of the phenomenal appearances, and
not of the Reality behind them. Science has not been able to solve the ultimate questions: What is
the ultimate stuff of the world? Who am I? What is the ultimate truth?

Science tells us that the ultimate goal of everything is unknown, and unknowable. But,
Vedanta teaches that the ultimate goal is Brahman or the Infinite, and that It can be realised through
hearing, reflection and meditation. The knowledge of the scientist is limited. It is only superficial. It
is not real knowledge of the Truth. Scientists are immersed in transitory phenomena. They rely on
external instruments, lenses, etc., for their knowledge. Their old theories are exploded by new
theories. Their knowledge is not as infallible and true as the knowledge of the Self of the sages and
Yogins.

Science has got its limitations. Science does not have an instrument by which they could just
collect the supersensual or spiritual data, or those divine facts which exist in a subtle form but which
we cannot see. True experiences include the experiences of the three states, namely, the waking,

Matter And Spirit

60

RELIGION AND SCIENCE (II)

dream and deep sleep states. The Vedantin studies the three states. He gains more real knowledge
from deep sleep state. He gets a clue for the existence of the fourth state or the state of Turiya from
the deep sleep state.

The soul is beyond the realm of physical science. The soul is beyond the reach of material
science. Man is a soul, wearing the physical body. The soul is extremely subtle. It is subtler than
ether, mind and energy. Consciousness and intelligence are of the soul, and not of the body.
Consciousness is evidence of the existence of the soul. The soul is the immortal part of man.

Science is a systematic study of facts. It tries to reduce observations or observed facts into a
system. In order that the fact may be valid for science, it must be perceptible to the senses. Sensing
is false knowledge. Intuition is right knowledge. Intuitive knowledge alone is the highest
knowledge. It is imperishable, infinite knowledge of Truth.

A scientist is an extrovert. He bombards the atoms. He cannot find Pure Consciousness
there. He will have to withdraw the senses and rest in his own Inner Self. He must dive deep into the
ocean of Brahmic Consciousness.

Science And Religion

Science is not the enemy of religion, but a preparation for it. Science is an enemy of
superstition alone. Both religion and science are engaged in the search for Truth. Their attitudes are
essentially the same. But the fields of applications vary. Raja-Yoga is an exact science. Its methods
are very scientific. A scientist is an external Raja Yogi. Hindu Rishis,seers and sages have
recognized the harmonious relation between religion and science. The divorce of science from
religion is the cause of confusion and conflict. Science is religion as applied to the investigation of
Truth in the finite nature outside(cid:151)the object. Religion is science as applied to the realisation of the
Infinite, the Bhuma, the Truth that underlies all objects(cid:151)the Subject.

Science interprets on the phenomenal plane the One as energy. Religion interprets the One
as the Self, (cid:147)the Atman(cid:148). Science analyzes, classifies and explains phenomena. But Brahma-vidya
teaches you to transcend phenomena and attain immortality.

The scientific and the religious approaches to Truth are really complementary, and not
contradictory. Religion and science are the twin-brothers. They should help mutually and
harmoniously to search Truth and live the life of Truth here.

Science has to do with facts; religion with values. Where science ends, religion begins. A
close study of the observations and revelations of science brings a man nearer to God. Who gave
power to electrons? What is at the bottom of these electrons? What is that power that has combined
four parts of nitrogen and one part of oxygen? Who has framed the laws of nature? Nature is blind.
What is that intelligence that moves nature? Who is the primum mobile? A study of the physical
forces and the physical laws, an understanding of the mental forces and the mental laws, are not
sufficient to make us perfect. We should have a thorough knowledge and realisation of the
substratum that lies hidden behind these names and forms and all physical and mental phenomena.
Then only we will become perfect masters or full-blown adepts or Arhatas or Buddhas.

61

GOD EXISTS

Mind and intellect are finite instruments. They cannot realise the infinite Reality. But, they
are a means. When the intellect has passed through the various stages of reasoning, and when it has
been completely purified, then revelation dawns. True religion begins where the intellect ends.

Let it not be thought that religion is dogmatic, other-worldly, a pet tradition of blind
believers or irrational emotionalists. Religion is the most rational science, the science of life itself,
the science of man as he essentially is, not merely as he presumes himself to be. The basis for all the
secular sciences is Brahma-vidya or the Adhyatmic science. Brahma-vidya is the foremost among
all sciences, because by it one attains immortality. Secular experiences are partial, while spiritual
experiences is the experience-whole. If you know this supreme science of Brahma-vidya through
direct intuition, you will have knowledge of all other worldly sciences; just as you will have
knowledge of all articles made of clay, if you have knowledge of clay itself. You cannot learn this
Science of sciences in any university. You will have to learn this from a Brahma-srotri,
Brahma-Nishtha Guru, after controlling your senses and the mind.

Matter cannot be totally ignored; but, matter should be subordinated to spirit. Science
should be subordinate to Brahma-vidya. Science cannot be the be-all and end-all. If you end your
life in the laboratory alone, you cannot enjoy the eternal bliss of the Soul. You cannot attain the
supreme wisdom which can free you from births and deaths. Science cannot give you salvation.

Seek within. Stand not as beggar before the door of science-power that kills, more than
heals. Do not surrender yourself to the scientists. They are not able to explain anything. Science
knows nothing of the origin of life, the origin of thought, and the origin and destiny of human nature
and the universe. There are many questions to which religion alone can give answers(cid:151)and not
science.

THE STUDY OF THE SELF: FROM PHYSICS TO

METAPHYSICS

Sri Swami Krishnananda

Nobody can deny the existence of human society, without which day-to-day life itself is
unimaginable. The universe is made more of unseen, invisible things than what one can even
conceive of. It is not merely what appears to be there to the eyes. There is a mystery behind it to be
unravelled. The pure materialists and even the Samkhya thinkers, however ignore this invisible but
vital factors. Thus, they fail, finally. Not only this; probably, the very approach and the stance taken
by them is inadequate to the purpose. Their failure to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion in the
study of the universe from a purely materialistic and mechanistic point of view suggests that an
entirely new angle of vision is called for.

62

THE STUDY OF THE SELF: FROM PHYSICS TO METAPHYSICS

Gravitation Suggests An Organic Interconnectedness In The Universe

Generally, we have the feeling that matter is contained as a substance inside space. Very
rarely does one feel that there is such a thing called time. Man is inviolably connected with the
process of time. Yet, he thinks very little of it, but is acutely conscious of space. The dimensions of
matter, which man identifies with the substances of the world, are due to the extensions of space.
There is what is called distance, and that principle of distance is due to the existence of space. Man
has an intuitional apperception of the characteristic space, such that he does not bother much about
its nature. He thinks that it is all clear. Everyone knows what space is,(cid:151)it is a kind of emptiness, we
think, which contains every blessed thing. This was the original eighteenth or nineteenth century
conclusion of even physics, which led to the notion that the universe of astronomy is an
arrangement of material bodies which were formed out of the galaxies, and which constituted the
solar system, the earth, the planets, etc.

However, it is not evidently easy to accept that bodies are scattered independently in space,
as if they have no connection whatsoever among themselves. It is not that one mountain is here,
another there; or one tree is here, and another there; without any connection between the two. If they
were independent, there would be no gravitation at all. But even such bodies as planets are subject
to this force of gravitation; what to speak of other things. There is an attraction of bodies in a
mechanistic manner, as is usually held, conditioned by a mathematical formula. But, really, can the
relation be purely mechanistic? How is it possible that there is such a pull among bodies, if there is
no internal organic relation among themselves? This is a point that has been unearthed recently in
modern physics. The presence of a pull known as gravitation implies, and should imply, an inward,
or rather an invisible organic relation between one body and another, notwithstanding that there is a
distance of some light years between them. Look at the distance between the sun and the earth,(cid:151)an
unimaginable one. Yet, the gravitational attraction of the solar orb is so intense that it can compel
the planets to move round in their orbits,(cid:151)the spatial emptiness that is between them, making no
difference. It is, therefore, not true that space is emptiness, because by emptiness or vacuum,
generally, an absolute nothingness is meant. An absolute nothing cannot become a medium of
movement of any force such as gravitation. There is a necessary movement of a connecting link in
an invisible form so that gravitation becomes possible. How could the phenomenon of a total
vacuum operating as a medium of action between be explained? The principle of gravitation is a
visible indication that matter is not located in one place. There is an organic interconnection
between bodies. This is a deeper implication that comes to the surface, when an attempt is made to
understand the nature of space, and the relationship that obtains among bodies.

An affinity among bodies to what is called gravitation. When this force, operates among
human beings, it is bio-psychic affection. It can also be repulsion under certain circumstances.
There is chemical affinity and also psychological affinity, all which seem to be working among
human and even animals. It appears that Nature cannot manifest its purpose except by expressing
the inner content of its constituents. In every movement of Nature, whether it is organic or
inorganic, there seems to be a secret characteristic which reveals the interrelatedness of bodies.

Precise Working Of Material Bodies: An Indication Of Cosmic Intelligence

The deeper does one go into the world of matter, and the further does one move in the
direction of space, the more is the insight one gains into the secret of the operation of Nature, the
secret being an organic relation among bodies, which appears to be outwardly scattered in space. It
is impossible humanly to imagine how the earth, for instance, can move along the same track which
it was following for aeons up to this time, as if thers is a set of rails laid down on its path in space.
Man is used to thinking that things, like the planet earth, are inorganic, inanimate, incapable of
thought, without eyes to see, and minds to think. But the precision with which bodies work
surpasses even the best mathematical imagination. Perhaps, man, has invented the system of
mathematics only on the observation of the way in which material bodies operate. We are not
intending to refute the opinion of rationalists like Kant, however, in connection with the grounds of
mathematical intuition. It cannot be explained how such a precision can be possible at all, where the
action of the mind is not even apparent. Though this is difficult to understand because of man(cid:146)s
habit of thinking, probably, finally, he will have to come round to attribute an intellect or a reason to
what goes as inanimate existence. The inward affinity that physical bodies reveal in their activities
would sound as an implication of an organisation that they form among themselves. There is,
perhaps, a cosmic society, even as man has his own little, small human society.

The social sense that human beings have is a peculiar phenomenon. As observed earlier, the
notion of human society is a psychic network, which operates invisibly and subtly, connecting
bodies or individuals into a form of organisation called human society. In the formation of this
organisation, the bodies do not actually collide with one another. There is no physical contact,
necessarily. One human being can be several miles away from others. Yet they can form a body.
This shows that the system of organisation or mutual relationship has little to do with spatial
distance. It is something different altogether.

If society is nothing but an organisation of inward affinities, as is the case with human
society, one can very well agree that there is no way of explaining the intricate features behind the
operation of Nature except by accepting that there is a society of cosmic substances. Is not the solar
system thought to be one organisation? Certainly, so. But the distance that is there between one
planet and another, or between the planets and the sun, or, as the astronomers point out, between the
sun and the other galactical bodies, is vast, enormous! It is said that there are stars whose presence
cannot be known even with the most powerful of telescopes. But their presence exerts an influence
of a unique nature by means of emanation of rays, which, today, is recognised as a vital living
influence. Thus, the acceptance of the possibility of a cosmic society leads to the acceptance of an
intelligence behind it, from the observed fact of the precise working of the bodies. Else, why should
dead matter behave so sensibly and purposively?

Man does not seem to be living merely by the operation of physical objects which are visible
to the eyes. Perhaps, he is even more dependent on invisible influences than on visible things, and
his life seems to be connected to factors which range far beyond human perception and conception.

This is why, today, philosophers have stumbled, somehow, on the acceptance of a process
rather than a location, of bodies. Earlier, it was thought that things existed, or things can exist, only
within the boundaries of their bodies, and that they cannot have any relevance beyond their

64

THE STUDY OF THE SELF: FROM PHYSICS TO METAPHYSICS

location. But, the concept of process melts down this boundary that is set to the bodies of
substances, and bodies seem to flow into one another rather than maintain their isolated existences.
There is always a craving within every body to become a part and parcel of another body. This is the
principle of affection, the principle of love that is seen in Nature. It becomes more and more
manifest as one rises to organic levels. This does not mean that it is absent in inorganic Nature, but
merely that it is not visible to the naked eye.

Conclusions Of Science: Man Is Not Outside The Universe

What does the modern scientist say?

Matter has been dematerialised. Matter is no more considered to be a hard, solid substance.
Man is gradually evaporating into thin air, so thin, so ethereal, and so fine that a time has come now
when it is not possible to distinguish his own presence from the wider atmosphere of the universe.
The observing scientist, or the philosopher, is inside the universe. This is important to remember.
How can man look at the universe when he is a part of it? How can man study anything in this
world? How can he make an analysis of any object, if he is not really outside it? From the fact of the
conclusions that one arrives at through the consequences following from the law of gravitation, it
follows that the universal structure cannot exclude the contents thereof. Man is not outside the
universe. This should be a simple fact. If he is not outside the universe, how can he study the
universe? Where comes the need and the necessity, or even the possibility of his observing
anything? Here is the crux of the whole situation. The problem that hangs like an iron curtain in
front of the modern scientist is this difficulty of his inability to disentangle himself from the object
of his observation. The great physicist,Heisenberg, discovered that he was involved in the very
thing in which he was engaged. The body of the scientist is not outside the body that is to be
observed. This is a kind of corollary that follows from the famous theory of Relativity. The
space-time-gravitation cosmos is one complex, or it may be called a compound, if you like. It is
such a terrific phenomenon that one gets frightened even by thinking of it.

Study Of The Self Is Imperative To The Study Of The Universe

While studying the nonmathematical, or, rather,

the super-mathematical nature of
subatomic structures,(cid:151)this is the field of subatomic physics,(cid:151)the nuclear physics which has been
studied in quantum mechanics, and the theory of Relativity, noticed that the force of gravitation,
which ruled the world of space and time, had to be reconciled with. This great task, Einstein took
upon himself, when he was working at the theory called Unified Field Theory, wherein (cid:147)this(cid:148) is
identified with (cid:147)that(cid:148),(cid:151)tattvamasi,(cid:151)(cid:147)That thou art,(cid:147)(cid:151)the famous doctrine of the Upanishad. The
quantum mechanics of Max Planck may be said to be the study of the (cid:147)thou(cid:148) or the (cid:147)this(cid:148), the
nuclear element, or the visible, which is immediately present as an individual structure; and the
(cid:147)that(cid:148) is the space-time continuum and the gravitation of the universe, which Einstein studied in his
General Theory of Relativity. The Special Theory and the General Theory put together, present a
tremendous upheaval in the discovery of science. Man is forced to study the universe together with
a study of his own self, because he is not outside the universe.

Inasmuch as man is not outside the universe, he is integral with it. He is a small in his own
self. Whatever is in Nature should also be within him, and the system which is seen to operate

65

GOD EXISTS

within himself may be said to be the system that operates in external Nature also. So, Indian
philosophers diverted the attention from the objective universe to the subjective individuality in
order that the whole cosmos could be envisaged at one stroke.

There is an analogy in Indian logic called (cid:147)sthalipulaka nyaya,(cid:148) the argument of the
recognition of the boiling of rice in a pot. While boiling rice in a pot, if it is required to know
whether the rice is fully cooked or not, one grain is squeezed; if it is seen to have been cooked, well,
it may be concluded that the whole rice has been cooked, and every grain need not be individually
inspected.

So is this analogy of the study of the cosmos by a study of man, as such. The study of man is
the study of the universe. (cid:147)Know thyself(cid:148) is the oracle of Delphi; Tattvamasi, is the proclamation of
the Upanishad. That the knowledge of the self is the knowledge of the cosmos is a universally
accepted doctrine of all philosophies and religions today.

Many a time, one it not able to understand how it is possible for one to know the universe
when one is here as a separate individual. Where comes the connection between the knowledge of
one(cid:146)s own self and the knowledge of the universe, or vice versa? The reason is simple. The universe
is a complete organism, comparable to the human organism, so to say. A complete organism is a
total Selfhood. The whole cosmos is an organism, and it is Selfhood in its nature. Its Selfhood can
be compared to one(cid:146)s own selfhood because it is inseparable from one, and one is inseparable from
it. That is how man can, perhaps, try to understand it. The study of the universe is the study of the
Self of the universe, and the study of the Self of the universe cannot preclude the study of one(cid:146)s own
self. The knowledge of the universe is the knowledge of the perceiver of the universe;i.e., one(cid:146)s
own self. If one knows one(cid:146)s own self, well, everything else also is known simultaneously, because
man is the symbol, or the microcosmic specimen of whatever constitutes Nature as a whole. One
thing is the same as the other.

Perhaps, here, one gradually stumbles again, upon the truth that the knowledge of God and
the knowledge of the Self, means the same thing. They are not two different things. God is the name
that is given to the Self of the cosmos, the vitality behind everything, the indivisible compound and
the utter reality of the most inexplicable character behind and within the universe. The knowledge
of the Self is the key to the knowledge of anything.

All philosophy, or any kind of investigatioin for that matter, commences with immediately
available evidence. This is the method followed by logic, where, from the particulars one goes to
the generals; i.e., from available information the implications therefrom are dug deep into, or, the
other way, from the basic indubitable fact of being, all else is derived as a corollary. The fault of the
materialists lay in this that they misunderstood what the most immediate fact is. They took it to be
the world that they see around. They ignored the most immediate thing, one(cid:146)s own existence. No
one can doubt one(cid:146)s own invulnerable reality as the foundation for any thought or action.

We have an inveterate obsession in our minds which prevents us almost entirely from
conceiving the goal of life as a practical reality. For us, the goal mostly remains as a kind of concept
and an idea, an ideal which is not easily reconcilable with the hard realities of the workaday a world.
The goal may be God Himself, and nevertheless, He is only an idea an ideal, a concept, an
imagination, a possibility, a may-be or may-not-be.

This suspicious outlook is not absent even in the most advanced persons due to the strength
of the senses, the power of the mind, and the habit of the intellect in understanding things in a given
fashion. We are discussing in these lessons a subject called Comparative Philosophy, and in this
context, we would be benefited by bestowing a little thought on the conclusions arrived at by certain
thinkers also, apart from Vedantic philosophers like Sankara, with whom we have a good
acquaintance and about whose thinking we have spoken enough.

There was a great man called Plato in Greece. According to Paul Deussen, the whole world
has produced only three philosophers(cid:151)Plato, Kant and Sankara. There is some truth in what he
says. There cannot be a greater philosopher than these three persons(cid:151)Plato, Kant and Sankara(cid:151),
says Paul Deussen. I was thinking about this statement. Why does he make this statement? Finally I
felt that there is some truth in it, whatever it is.

The idea of the Ultimate Reality is the principal doctrine of Plato; and I started by saying
that we are living in a world of ideas when we live a spiritual life, when we behave religiously,
conduct worship and chant Mantras, do prayers, do Japa and even meditation; but there is a very
uncomfortable consequence following the idea that, after all, the Reality is an idea.

Ideas are abstractions, notions which are supposed to correspond to realities, and as long as
ideas correspond to realities, they are valid. I have an idea that there is a building in front of me. This
idea is a valid idea, because it corresponds with the real existence of the building outside. So, the
validity of my idea depends upon the reality of the object which is in front of it, but my idea itself
has no reality. It is borrowed reality. It hangs on the existence of something else outside, in this case,
the building. So, if the idea of the Ultimate Reality or God is to hang on the existence of another
thing, God is not a real being. This is a very subtle difficulty that may trouble the minds of even
sincere seekers. Don(cid:146)t you think that the world is real? It is not merely real, it is very, very real, hard
to the core, flint-like and no one can gainsay that it is. Perhaps that alone is.

God is an idea that has been introduced in our minds by our ancestors, by our books, by our
scriptures, by our professors and our teachers and parents, and somehow, we have been forced by
the logic of this teaching to believe there should be such a thing as an (cid:145)other-worldly existence(cid:146) and
we have somehow reconciled ourselves to it(cid:151)God must be there. But we are accepting the
existence of God against our own will. We are hungry and thirsty and this hunger and thirst of the
body is more real than the idea of God. No one can say that it is not so, whatever be our devotion to
God. This is so even in the case of advanced seekers and sincere Sadhaks (aspirants). This subject is
the principal theme of Plato(cid:146)s doctrine.

67

GOD EXISTS

Ideas precede reality: this one sentence is the entire philosophy of Plato. The reality of the
objective universe is subsequent to the idea of the universe. Here we have an echo of the great
philosophy of Vedanta that the Hiranyagarbha (cosmic intelligence) is prior to the cosmos of
physical appearance. The Panchadasi, The Upanishads and the other systems of Vedantic thinking
tell us that in Hiranyagarbha the world does not exist in a concrete form as it appears, that is only an
idea cosmically manifested by Isvara (God) who is even subtler than the idea. Isvara is only a
possibility of the very idea that there should be a thing called the universe. So, Isvara is subtler than
the idea which is Hiranyagarbha, and Virat is supposed to be the animating consciousness behind
the so-called physicality of creation. So, even in the Vedantic Philosophy, there is the same doctrine
of idea preceding concrete existence. But we can never believe this.

My idea that there is a desk in front of me cannot be said to be harder in its concreteness than
the desk itself. I have an idea that there is a little table in front of me. Is the table more real or the idea
that the table is there more real? Any man with common-sense will say that the idea is subsequent to
the existence of the object called table and the idea is not preceding the object. Because there is a
table, you think there is a table. You have an idea that there is an object. So, the idea that there is an
object is the consequence of the existence of the object. So, the idea of God must be subsequent and
not precedent.

These questions arose before Socrates. How can you say that idea is prior to the universe?
How could there be an idea unless the universe exists? How can you have a thought about a thing
unless the thing exists? How can you say that things are subsequent and ideas are precedent?

If God is supreme consciousness, how could consciousness be prior to existence?
Consciousness is always of something. If the something is not there, there cannot be consciousness.
What do you mean by merely saying consciousness, awareness, understanding, thinking, feeling?
They cannot have any significance unless they are connected to a thing which is already there. This
is the gross realistic doctrine of empirical philosophers which was highlighted by British thinkers
like Locke, Berkeley and Hume, but already anticipated by people like Plato and Aristotle in a
different fashion.

This is a very terrible problem before us. Notwithstanding the fact that we are devotees of
God and honest religious thinkers, the concreteness of the world and the reality of the things we see
with our eyes and contact with our senses cannot be abrogated merely by the notion that ideas are
precedent. Ideas cannot be precedent as long as we are accustomed to thinking in the way we are
thinking today. (cid:147)Here is a man coming(cid:148): I am saying like this. This man is there; therefore I have an
idea that he is coming. If the man was not there, the idea cannot be there. It is not the I think the man
first than the man comes. The man is there and the idea comes afterwards.

So, realism has a great fort before it. There cannot be an idea unless an object exists already.
So God must be afterwards and the world first. Here is materialism, which has a very strong ground.
Consciousness cannot be there, unless the object is there. So, what you call consciousness is only an
exudation, a manifestation, a kind of an already existing material stuff. Crude materialism, realism,
is impossible to face easily. You cannot answer this question. You yourself will not be able to say
anything in this matter; so you say there is something in it.

68

This problem is an indication of the state in which we are placed. How far are we advanced
spiritually? Where is our spirituality, where is our God, love and God-consciousness? Incidentally,
it is not a joking matter or a humor. It is a very, very serious thing for us. Whatever be the study of
the scriptures, we cannot get out of the idea that we are living in a very, very hard, flint-like,
iron-like, steel-like world; and we can never accept that the idea of the world is in any way more real
than the world. But Plato affirms that the ideas are more real than the world. The universals are
precedent to the particulars. Horse-ness is prior to the horse. Table-ness is prior to the table,
buildingness is prior to the building. How could there be horse-ness before there is a horse? We
cannot answer these questions easily. We know very well that there cannot be horse-ness unless the
horse was already there. But man(cid:146)s mind is very poor. It is not wholly philosophical and we cannot
understand how there could be an idea of a thing unless the thing was already there. How could
God(cid:146)s consciousness be there if God is only Consciousness?

We have been indoctrinated in this belief not merely in this birth, but throughout the births
we have lived through in earlier incarnations. The difficulty arises on account of the impressions
created in our minds by hanging on to objects of sense through the many births we have passed
through.

The little spiritual aspiration that we have is a late development in the process of evolution.
Let each one of us think, (cid:147)Since when am I thinking of God, religion and spirituality? Since how
many years back?(cid:148). Compared to these few years of our ardent adventure in the spiritual field, what
a long, long time we have passed in other types of thinking! The heavy weight of the errors in the
thoughts of our previous lives hangs on us so vehemently and powerfully that our little aspiration is
submerged. So, again and again we have suspicions in our minds. Doubts are galore. Very great
difficulties are there. (cid:147)Am I fit? Am I right? Is there any substance in it? Am I living in a foolish
world, a fool(cid:146)s paradise? Nothing is coming. I have been meditating for years, nothing is visible. I
may be hoodwinked. Is there any point in it at all or is it all a waste?(cid:148). These doubts can come even
to sincere seekers.

The idea of the world is not dependent upon the world. The world is dependent of the idea.
In a crude form, Berkeley said this. But, in a more philosophical fashion, Plato affirmed it. We can
never stomach this idea that consciousness is precedent to matter, though we have attempted to
convince ourselves, in our previous discussions, that consciousness is our essential reality by an
analysis conducted of the three states(cid:151)waking, dream and deep sleep. We have already understood
this to some extent. We have gone to the depths of our condition in deep sleep where we appear to
exist only as pure consciousness minus body and mind in the state of deep sleep, that must have
been what our stuff is. This so-called body of ours, this hard substance of contactual experience, and
the mind which thinks of it, are subsequent evolutes; and if they were the ultimate realities that we
are, they would not have perished in deep sleep also. But we had no experience of body or mind
there. We were bare, featureless, unobjectified being, consciousness only. This is what we learnt in
our earlier analysis of the condition of sleep. What were you in deep sleep? Not man, not woman,
not human being, not body, not mind, not anything, not object. What were you then? A bare
impersonal, indefinite, undivided awareness you were. So, this consciousness that you were is the
same as consciousness of being(cid:151)being inseparable from consciousness, consciousness
inseparable from being.

69

GOD EXISTS

This is the great conclusion of Vedanta philosophy(cid:151)Being-Consciousness. Sat-Chit was
your essential nature(cid:151)not body, not mind, not anything that the senses perceive or conceive, not
the world. Then, wherefrom this body came? What is this body? What is the world? What are these
buildings and stony mountains and the flowing rivers and the burning sun? What is all this? From
where have they come?

They are also ideas. When Berkeley said that all the trees, the mountains, the heaven and the
earth were only ideas, Samuel Johnson, it seems, later on kicked a brick and said, (cid:147)I hereby refute
Berkeley.(cid:148) Kicking a brick does not refute Berkeley. It is a very prosaic way of confronting this
poor bishop. There was some mistake in the thinking of Samuel Johnson. You cannot kick a brick
and say, (cid:147)I have refuted Berkeley(cid:148), because Berkeley includes Johnson himself, not merely the
brick, in his doctrine of ideas.

Electric repulsions can produce a sensation of hardness, as many of you, or some of you at
least, must have experienced when you had an electric shock. If you touch a live wire with a heavy
voltage flowing through it, you will have a sensation of terrible weight and solidity, though there is
nothing there. You will feel a mountain hanging on your hand. Any of you who ever had a shock
would know what it is. How could this idea of heavy weight of a hill hanging on your hand be a
sensation when there was nothing whatsoever except the fact that you touched a live wire? Why go
so far? Come to our modern scientists.

These solid objects(cid:151)maybe of steel or granite(cid:151)are constituted of electric energy inside.
Pure energy, electric energy(cid:151)we may say electricity itself. What is electricity? It cannot be seen, it
has no weight, it has no dimensions, no length, breadth, or height. But it is the raw material of heavy
substances which have length, breadth and height. This indescribable continuum of force and
motion has become the atoms and molecules, hard things like the mountains and the solar system.

this space-time continuum is except

Go further still. The doctrine of relativity lands in a mere idea of the cosmos. The space-time
stuff that they speak of as the ultimate substance is not a hard reality. Neither can space be called a
hard reality like a table, nor time. But, researches into the substance of physics seem to conclude
that the hardest realities like hills and rocks are constituted of configurations of the space-time
continuum. We cannot understand what
is a
mathematical heap of point-events in the brain of the scientist(cid:151)and not a human scientist at that!
Here, Berkeley rectifies himself when he says that the world is an idea, not of Mr. Berkeley, but of a
larger being in whom all
ideas are also included. We again come to the
Hiranyagarbha of Vedanta philosophy, though such words were not used by Berkeley or Plato.
Plato used the words, (cid:147)Idea of the good.(cid:148) A strange definition of his. You may say, (cid:147)Idea of God(cid:148) if
you like. It is not an idea of God, but the idea which is God. Actually, God is only an idea; not your
idea, but an Idea as such, which is the cause of other ideas. The Yoga Vasishtha goes into great
detail in explaining this point that the whole universe is mind. Not my mind, or your mind, but mind
as such. Pure impersonal existence, of which our minds and thoughts and feelings and evolutions
are ripples.

the individual

that

it

Read the great book of Samuel Alexander, (cid:147)Space, Time and Deity(cid:148), which is the great
exposition of the structure of the universe which is so hard and real in space-time only. Space-time
is not a substance. It is not something tangible. You cannot touch it, you cannot see it, you cannot

70

ALICE IN WONDERLAND

sense it, you cannot taste it, you cannot smell it. And a thing which cannot be sensed is not reality at
all. But that is the reality!

It pinpoints, pressurises into a movement, a force. And space-time becomes motion,
manifesting itself into the primary qualities of length, breadth and height. Remember length,
breadth and height do not mean length, breadth and height of a substance. They have never come
into being. These are difficult things to understand. Only a purely impersonal thinker or
mathematician will be able to appreciate or understand. How can there be a conception of length,
breadth and height unless objects are there?

But space-time is itself without dimensions. It has no dimensions. It is a four dimensional
something(cid:151)not a three dimensional substance. And we do not know what this four dimensional
thing is. It is only an idea, a meaningless thing for us. It becomes primary qualities like length,
breadth and height, etc. Geometrical partners are called primary qualities which manifest
themselves as secondary qualities of colour, sound, taste, smell, etc. The world has not come into
being yet. They are only Tanmatras (subtle undifferentiated root elements of matter)(cid:151)Shabda
(sound), Sparsa (touch), Rupa (form), Rasa (taste), Gandha (smell), says the Vedanta philosophy.
These Tanmatras are not substances, but principles behind the objects which produce these
sensations. They are not hard substances like earth, water, fire, air and ether; they are comparable to
the secondary qualities of Aristotle and Plato and modern scientists.

Oh, what a wonder! We seem to be living in a dreamland like Alice in Wonderland. We are
not living in a world as it appears. The primary qualities condensing themselves into secondary
qualities of sensations, solidify themselves as it were into hard realities like heaviness that you feel
when you get an electrical shock.

So, under these conclusions, it appears that the solidity and the substantiality of this
physical world is comparable to the solidity and substantiality of the mountain that you felt
weighing heavily in your hand when you had a heavy voltage shock. Does the world exist? No one
knows.

Now, even your own body is of the same nature. This substantiality of the world which has
been reduced practically into nothing but a sensation and an idea of a cosmic existence includes the
very notion of our body also, so that we also go, the scientists also go into that conclusions. Sir
Arthur Eddington said that no scientists can live in this world without going mad. Fortunately, he
did not want to go mad, because, under these conclusions, no one can exist here for three minutes.
Buddha said this. A really perceiving individual cannot exist in this world for three days. He will
melt into nothing. But the fact that perception has not arisen is the reason why we are very happy
here. So, ignorance is the cause of our very comfortable existence. Now this comparative study of
Eastern conclusions with Western discoveries seems to make us feel that all great men are thinking
alike(cid:151)whether Plato or Aristotle, Kent or Hegel, Acharya Sankara or Vidyaranya Swami.

Ideas are therefore not ideas of things which are earlier than the ideas, just as space and time
are not subsequent to what we call the objective world, but precedent to the objective world. It is the
final conclusion of Sir James Jean, for instance, that God must be a mathematician. It is not a man
thinking mathematical point, but mathematics itself. How can you only think mathematics, without

71

GOD EXISTS

a person thinking mathematics? He says it is a mathematical consciousness, highly abstract, purely
impersonal, and the universe is nothing but conceptions of mathematical point-events.

Today we are in this world of modern physics. And what is Hiranyagarbha, what is Isvara,
but there things in Sanskrit language? What is Shabda, Sparsa, Rupa, Rasa and Gandha but
conceptual precedents of the hard things called earth, water, fire, air and ether including our
physical bodies? We can imagine we have difficulties in meditation, why we cannot do Japa, why
we cannot do prayer. We get angry for little things and we fly at the throat of another brother,
because we are yet to be spiritual.

Religion has not yet entered us fully. We are playing jokes with God at least now. These
deeper truths are not capable of easy entrance into our minds, because we are busybodies, very busy
with bricks and mortar and vegetables and tea and coffee. These are greater realities to us than the
supernal ideas that are the content of our religious and spiritual consciousness.

I brought those ideas before you to bring about a comparison between the greatest thinkers
of the East like Acharya Sankara, the Rishis of the Upanishads, and Sri Krishna of the Bhagavad
Gita and Western thinkers like Plato, Aristotle and Kant. They seem to be thinking alike. Only they
seem to be thinking in different languages and giving different definitions.

So we are now face to face with the great reality, the God of the cosmos. We have passed
through the analysis. We have conducted a study of the three stages of consciousness(cid:151)waking,
dream and deep sleep. We studied epistomological processes(cid:151)the perception of the world, how we
come in contact with things, and how we know that the world exists at all. This also we have
concluded. Many of you may not remember it, but think over or see your diaries if you have noted
anything down.

Now we are facing the third principle of the ultimate reality of the cosmos, call it the
Absolute, call it Satchidananda, God, Isvara, Hiranyagarbha, Virat, whatever it is. Here, true
religion begins. Real religion is an awareness of the presence of the Supreme Being. Therefore, it is
well said that religion begins where intellect ends, where reasons fails. When religion begins
controlling your life, you cease to be a mere intellectual or a scientist or a philosopher. You are no
more a thinker, but a person who lives reality.

Religion is living reality and not merely thinking reality or academic analysing. All this is
over already in our earlier lessons. We have thought enough philosophically, academically and
hope we shall not
touch this subject again. We shall enter into true religion which is
God-consciousness itself in some proportion, in some measure, in a modicum.

To face God and to encounter Him in our actual life is to live religion. So, religion is not
ringing a bell, waving a light, or chanting a Mantra. It is encountering God face to face. So, religion
is superior to philosophy, if you understand religion in the true sense of the term. Religion is not
Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism. It is the art of envisaging God-being.

Man melting, like ice vanishing before the blaze of the sun. That is religion. When the sun of
God-consciousness rises, this substance called body-consciousness evaporates into an ethereal

nothing. Gradually, we begin to approximate God-being. The life of religion is the way of gradual
approximation to God-consciousness. Here, true love begins to preponderate in our lives. We do
not merely think of God as philosophers or academicians or professors. We love God; and we
cannot love a thing which is not really there. We cannot love a thing which is only an idea or a
concept in our mind.

All love is an urge of the soul to contact that which it feels as a hard reality in front of itself.

Every love is God-love finally and the final stuff of the universe may be said to be love.

I have been telling you sometimes that there is some secret meaning behind the last words in
the Eleventh Chapter of the Gita where we are told that Bhakti is supreme. The Bhakti that Sri
Krishna speaks of here is not ordinary obeisance to an idol. It is not a mass that you perform in the
church. It is a melting of your being before the Absolute. Therefore Bhagavan Sri Krishna says,
(cid:147)Not charity, not philanthropy, not study, not austerity, is capable of bringing about this great vision
that you had, Arjuna! (cid:224)(cid:224)(cid:224) Only by devotion can I be seen, contacted. Only by devotion am I capable
of being known, seen and entered into(cid:148). These three words are used in the Bhagavad Gita at the end
of the Eleventh Chapter(cid:151)knowing, seeing, and entering. Arjuna knew and saw, but never entered
into It. Therefore, he was the same Arjuna after the Bhagavad Gita also. He never merged into the
Supreme Being.

Now, religion is knowing, seeing and entering into. Knowing is considered by such thinkers
like Ramanuja, the great propounder of the Visishtadvaita philosophy, as inferior to devotion. I am
now digressing a little bit from the point, into another thing altogether, which is also interesting.

Knowledge or Jnana is not equal to Bhakti, says Ramanuja, the great propounder of the
doctrine and philosophy called Visishtadvaita. And Acharya Sankara says that Jnana is superior to
Bhakti. It may appear that they are quarrelling. They have some emphasis laid on different aspects
of the same question. Why does Bhagavan Sri Krishna say that nothing can make you fit to see the
vision of God, to behold Him, except Bhakti? It would seem that He speaks like Ramanuja and not
like Sankara. But they are only speaking in different languages (cid:224) the same thing. There is no
contradiction between them. (cid:147)Knowing, seeing and entering into(cid:148) signifies the process of
contacting God by degrees. There is,
two types of
knowledge(cid:151)Paroksha Jnana and Aporkasha Jnana. Paroksha Jnana is direct knowledge. (cid:147)God
exists(cid:148) is indirect knowledge. Now, we do not feel that we are inseparable from God(cid:146)s being. That
knowledge has not come to us. So we have not entered such a height of religious consciousness as to
be convinced that we are inseparable from God(cid:146)s existence. But we are convinced enough to feel
that God exists.

in the parlance of Vedanta,

At

least

the people seated here are perhaps convinced that God must be. He is.
Circumstances compel us to feel confidently that God must be, that God is. But we have not gone to
such an extent to feel that we are inseparable from Him. That is a little higher stage. We have known
in an indirect way. Jnana has come, but darshana or vision of God has not come. We have not seen
Virat in front of us, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing Virat. This whole cosmos is that, but
somehow we have segregated our personality from Virat consciousness. A cell in the body is seeing
the body as if it is outside it.

73

GOD EXISTS

The way in which we are seeing the universe now is something like the possibility of a
particular organism, called the cell in the body, separating itself in motion(cid:151)not really of
course(cid:151)from the bodily organism and looking at the body. What would be the condition or the
experience of a cell in our own body notionally isolating itself from the organism to which it
belongs and considering the body as a world outside it? You can imagine the stupidity of it. This is
exactly what we are doing. We think that the world is outside us. We can fly into space, drive in a
motor car on a road, because a peculiar notion has become a reality in our mind, that the world is
outside us though we are a part of the world. So, the idea that the Virat is an of perception, that the
world is external to us, is notional and not realistic. All our difficulties are notional in the end. They
have no reality or substance in themselves. We are bound by our minds, our thoughts, our feelings
and our willings. So when Acharya Sankara says that Jnana is superior and Ramanuja says that
Bhakti is superior, they are saying the same thing.

By Bhakti, Ramanuja means that love of God which supersedes intellectual activity or a
mere knowing that God exists. And when Sankara says that Jnana or knowledge is superior, he
means knowledge which is identical with being and which is same as Para Bhakti or the love of God
where the soul is in communion with the Being of God.

The highest devotion is the same as the highest knowledge. Jnana and Para Bhakti are the
same. The Gauna Bhakti or secondary love of God, which is more ritualistic and more formal, is
inferior. But Ramanuja(cid:146)s Bhakti is the surging of the soul and the melting of personality in
God-experience. It is to become mad with God-love as we hear in the case of Spinoza, Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa, Mirabai and Tukaram. Their Bhakti was not simply love of God as that of
churchmen or templemen. It is a kind of ecstasy in which the personality has lost itself in God-love
and God-being. That is Jnana and that is Bhakti. So, there is no difference between Ramanuja and
Sankara in the ultimate reaches. And Bhagavan Sri Krishna(cid:146)s dictum is also of a similar character.

So now, when we are discussing the final point in our studies, we are gradually losing
attachments to his obsessional notion that we are this little Mr. and Mrs. Body and that we are
located in a part of the physical world called India or America, Japan or Russia. And we are slowly
trying to become citizens of a larger dimension which is wider than this earth, perhaps larger than
even the solar system and this physical cosmos.

When we enter into the true religious life, we become real children of God. Hari Om Tat Sat.

SEVEN REASONS WHY A SCIENTIST BELIEVES IN GOD

SEVEN REASONS WHY A SCIENTIST BELIEVES IN GOD

A. Cressy Morrison

[Former President of the New York Academy of Sciences]

WE ARE STILL IN THE DAWN of the scientific age, and every increase of light reveals
more brightly the handiwork of an intelligent Creator. We have made stupendous discoveries; with
a spirit of scientific humility and of faith grounded in knowledge we are approaching ever nearer to
an awareness of God.

For myself, I count seven reasons for my faith:

First: By unwavering mathematical law we can prove that our universe was designed and

executed by a great engineering intelligence.

Suppose you put ten pennies, marked from one to ten, into your pocket and give them a good
shuffle. Now try to take them out in sequence from one to ten, putting back the coin each time and
shaking them all again. Mathematically we know that your chance of first drawing number one is
one in ten; of drawing one and two in succession, one in 100; of drawing one, two and three in
succession, one in 1000, and so on; your chance of drawing them all, from number one to number
ten in succession, would reach the unbelievable figure of one in ten billion.

By the same reasoning, so many exacting conditions are necessary for life on the earth that
they could not possibly exist in proper relationship by chance. The earth rotates on its axis 1000
miles an hour at the equator; if it turned at 100 miles an hour, our days and nights would be ten times
as long as now, and the hot sun would likely burn up our vegetation each long day while in the long
night any surviving sprout might well freeze.

Again the sun, source of our life, has a surface temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
and our earth is just far enough away so that this (cid:147)eternal life(cid:148) warms us just enough and not too
much ! If the sun gave off only one half its present radiation, we would freeze, and if it gave as much
more, we would roast.

The slant of the earth, tilted at an angle of 23 degrees, gives us our seasons; if the earth had
not been so tilted, vapors from the ocean would move north and south, piling up for us continents of
ice. If our moon were, say, only 50,000 miles away instead of its actual distance, our tides might be
so enormous that twice a day all continents would be submerged; even the mountains could soon be
eroded away. If the crust of the earth had only been ten feet thicker, there would be no oxygen,
without which animal life must die. Had the ocean been a few feet deeper, carbon dioxide and
oxygen would have been absorbed and no vegetable life could exist.

It is apparent from these and a host of other examples that there is not one chance in billions

that life on our planet is an accident.

75

GOD EXISTS

Second: The resourcefulness of life to accomplish its purpose is a manifestation of an

all-pervading Intelligence.

What life itself is, no man has fathomed. It has neither weight nor dimensions, but it does
have force; a growing root will crack a rock. Life has conquered water, land and air, mastering the
elements, compelling them to dissolve and reform their combinations.

Life, the sculptor, shapes all living things; an artist, it designs every leaf of every tree, and
colors every flower. Life is a musician and has taught each bird to sing its love song, the insects to
call one another in the music of their multitudinous sounds. Life is a sublime chemist, giving taste to
fruits and spices, and perfume to the rose, changing water and carbonic acid into sugar and wood,
and, in so doing, releasing oxygen that animals may have the breath of life.

Behold an almost invisible drop of protoplasm, transparent, jellylike, capable of motion,
drawing energy from the sun. This single cell, this transparent mist-like droplet, holds within itself
the germ of life, and has power to distribute this life to every living thing, great and small. The
powers of this droplet are greater than our vegetation and animals and people, for all life came from
it. Nature did not create life; fire-blistered rocks and a saltless sea could not meet the necessary
requirements.

Who, then, has put it here?

Third: Animal wisdom speaks irresistibly of a good Creator who infused instinct into

otherwise helpless little creatures.

The young salmon spends years at sea, then comes back to his own river, and travels up the
very side of the river into which flows the tributary where he was born. What brings him back so
precisely ? If you transfer him to another tributary he will know at once that he is off his course and
he will fight his way down and back to the main stream and then turn up against the current to finish
his destiny accurately.

Even more difficult to solve is the mystery of eels. These amazing creatures migrate at
maturity from ponds and rivers everywhere(cid:151)those from Europe across thousands of miles of
ocean(cid:151)all bound for the same abysmal deeps near Bermuda. There they breed and die. The little
ones, with no apparent means of knowing anything except that they are in a wilderness of water,
nevertheless start back and find their way not only to the very shore from which their parents came
but thence to the selfsame rivers, lakes or little ponds. No American eel has ever been caught in
Europe, no European eel in American waters. Nature has even delayed the maturity of the European
eel by a year or more to make up for its longer journey. Where does the directional impulse
originate question

Fourth: Man has something more than animal instinct(cid:151)the power of reason.

No other animal has ever left a record of its ability to count ten, or even to understand the
meaning of ten. Where instinct is like a single note of a flute, beautiful but limited, the human brain
contains all the notes of all the instruments in the orchestra. No need to belabor this fourth point;

76

SEVEN REASONS WHY A SCIENTIST BELIEVES IN GOD

thanks to human reason we can contemplate the possibility that we are what we are only because we
have received a spark of Universal Intelligence.

Fifth: Provision for all living is revealed in such phenomena as the wonders of genes.

So tiny are these genes that, if all of them responsible for all living people in the world could
be put in one place, there would be less than a thimbleful. Yet these genes inhabit every living cell
and are the keys to all human, animal and vegetable characteristics. A thimble is a small place to
hold all the individual characteristics of almost three billion human beings. However, the facts are
beyond question.

Here evolution really begins(cid:151)at the cell, the entity which holds and carries the genes. That
the ultra-microscopic gene can absolutely rule all life on earth is an example of profound cunning
and provision that could emanate only from a Creative Intelligence; no other hypothesis will serve.

Sixth: By the economy of nature, we are forced to realise that only infinite wisdom could

have foreseen and prepared with such astute husbandry.

Many years ago a species of cactus was planted in Australia as a protective fence. Having no
insect enemies in Australia, the cactus soon began a prodigious growth; the alarming abundance
persisted until the plants covered an area as long and wide as England, crowding inhabitants out of
the towns and villages, and destroying their farms. Seeking a defense, entomologists scoured the
world; finally they turned up an insect which lived exclusively on cactus, and would eat nothing
else. It would breed freely, too; and it had no enemies in Australia. So animal soon conquered
vegetable, and today the cactus pest has retreated(cid:151)and with it all but a small protective residue of
the insects, enough to hold the cactus in check forever.

Such checks and balances have been universally provided. Why have not fast-breeding
insects dominated the earth? Because they have no lungs such as man possesses; they breathe
through tubes. But when insects grow large, their tubes do not grow in ratio to the increasing size of
the body. Hence there never has been an insect of great size; this limitation on growth has held them
all in check. If this physical check had not been provided, man could not exist. Imagine meeting a
hornet as big as a lion !

Seventh: The fact that man can conceive the idea of God is in itself a unique proof.

The conception of God rises from a divine faculty of man, unshared with the rest of our
world(cid:151)the faculty we call imagination. By its power, man and man alone can find the evidence of
things unseen. The vista that power opens up is unbounded; indeed, as man(cid:146)s perfected imagination
becomes a spiritual reality, he may discern in all the evidence of design and purpose the great truth
that heaven is wherever and whatever; that God is everywhere and in everything that nowhere so
close as in our hearts.

It is scientifically as well as imaginatively true, as the Psalmist said: The heavens declare the

Glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork.

IS MODERN SCIENCE A CHALLENGE TO RELIGION?

GOD EXISTS

Sri Swami Krishnananda

The subject that has been suggested is somewhat an involved one, and I do not know how far
this would be a very appropriate theme to discuss before an audience of this kind who are basically
devotees of God and aspirants of the spiritual ideal of life. However, all visions of life can be
consolidated into a system of integrated organisation, and nothing conceivable can be regarded as
extraneous to the methodology to be adopted in the pursuit of the spiritual ideal.

(cid:147)Is there a conflict between the scientific method and the religious aspiration of the soul?(cid:148) is
a moot question. Generally, when people speak of science, what the common populace understands
is the comfort that has been provided by applied science, such as fast travelling, telephone,
telegraph, Internet, satellite, and television. These are the things that are in the minds of people
when they speak of the technological advance science has made; but science does not mean
technology. It is a vision of life itself.

What clashes or appears to come in conflict with religion is not the comfort that has been
brought to us by these technological inventions of applied science, but the theory of science, which
is something very deep, and bordering upon philosophical and metaphysical foundations of life
itself.

That the world is external to everyone is the basic foundation of all scientific perception.
Observation and experiment being the methods of a scientific process, it goes without saying that
what is observed and experimented upon has to be outside. The outsideness of the world is a very
important aspect to be considered here, but we may put a question to our own selves: (cid:147)Is the world
really outside us, so that what happens in the world does not affect us in any way, and the world does
not care for what is happening to us in our own internal operations? Are the individual and the
world, the two principles of consideration here, segregated from each other? Has the world nothing
to do with the individual, and has the individual nothing to do with the world?(cid:148) It looks that there is
no communication possible between the individual and the world. The world may not know at all
that some individual is dead and gone, and the individual is not concerned in any manner if a star in
heaven cools down and extinguishes itself. Let anything happen to the heavens; what does it matter
to us? But, (cid:147)Is it so?(cid:148) is the question.

This supposed conflict between physical science and religion may be said to have begun
somewhere toward the end of the nineteenth century, when the geocentric interpretation of the
heavenly bodies was replaced by the heliocentric concept on the discovery of Copernicus. This
discovery clashed with the biblical belief and tradition, which holds that the earth is the foundation,
and the sun and the moon and the stars move round this earth.

The second thing that opposed religion as it was understood in those days was that the world
was created, according to the biblical tradition, some four thousand years ago, but the scientific
discovery declares that the beginning of the world must be traced back to aeons and aeons of time
process earlier, and the earth is several millions of years old. This again was a challenge to the
medieval concept of religion.

78

IS MODERN SCIENCE A CHALLENGE TO RELIGION?

But the third thing is most important. When Newton discovered the law of gravitation and
concluded that everything that is happening in the physical world can be mathematically deduced
by the logical process of conclusion drawn from premises, and the world which is physical in its
nature is contained within the cup of space and time, and when his successor or follower Laplace
wrote the five volumes on (cid:145)Celestial Mechanics,(cid:146) the war between science and religion appeared to
have commenced. We are told that the writings of Laplace were presented to Napoleon for his
consideration. Napoleon seems to have declared, (cid:147)Monsieur, I do not see God in your scheme(cid:148); and
the answer of Laplace seems to have been, (cid:147)Your highness, I have used the best of telescopes, but I
have not found God anywhere.(cid:148) This is classical science: God has to be seen in order to be believed.

Does it follow then that whatever we see with our eyes really exists? Can we establish
logically or scientifically that the world exists at all? Which scientific procedure can establish the
truth of the externality of the world? Science is against any kind of hypothesis and taking for
granted anything unproved. But is there any proof to substantiate the belief that the world exists,
except the assertion that it is seen? The senses come in contact with what we call the panorama of
the external world. That is the proof!

Here, science fumbles. It is trying to cut the ground from under its own feet. Taking
anything for granted is not the beginning of science. We cannot even take for granted that the world
exists unless we prove that it exists. One cannot prove one(cid:146)s own existence even. How do you know
that you are existing? Where is the syllogism by which you have deduced the consequence of your
existence from a premise? What is the proof that can establish the truth of your own existence?
Bring the argument and let us see what it is that tells you that you really exist.

It was the French philosopher Rene Descartes who took up this question of doubting the
existence of his own self: (cid:147)Some devil may be working in my mind. It may be telling me everything
in a topsy-turvy way. The world may not be there. I may not be here. Everything is doubtful. There
is no certainty of anything. I can doubt the validity of anything and everything.(cid:148) But he went deeper
into this phenomenon of doubt and discovered that doubt is not possible unless there is someone
who is to doubt; if the doubter also is to be doubted, the very fact of doubting loses its meaning.
Nobody can be an utter sceptic, because that defeats the very purpose of scepticism. I am thinking
and, therefore, I must be existing. This is Descartes(cid:146) conclusion.

What sort of existence is mine? I am conscious that I am existing. What

is that
consciousness? (cid:147)I am an individual; I am Mr. so-and-so,(cid:148) is my consciousness of existence. Is the
consciousness of the existence of a personality a complete acceptance of the truth of life? He
concluded that this cannot be the ultimate truth of life because there is a longing to break the
boundaries of personality in everyone.

No one can tolerate finitude. The finite consciousness, which is proved by the very fact of
my knowing that I am, establishes the validity of there being something which is not finite. What is
it that is not the finite? It should not be a multitude of finites; it should be the Infinite. My existence
as a finite being, substantiated by the indubitability of this assertion, also brings about a wider
unexpected consequence,ønamely the Infinite also should exist; therefore, God exists. If I am
existing, God has to exist, because the concept of God is only a cosmic correlative of the acceptance
of one(cid:146)s own being as a finite individual. The finiteness of individuality proves the infinitude of the

79

GOD EXISTS

Truth of life. This smashes the erstwhile concept of the externality of the world, and the dichotomy
that is seen between the perceiver and the perceived.

Now I am touching upon the threat that theoretical science poses before religion. Here, it is
also necessary to understand what religion is. Though we are trying to analyse the practical and
theoretical aspects of science, do we know what religion is? Religion basically is a longing for what
is above oneself. There is something transcending myself; but for that fact, I would be a most happy
person in this world. I would be carefree, secure ultimately, and perfect in every sense of the term.
But no one feels that one is perfect. There is always a complaint that something is wrong, something
is inadequate, something is insufficient. Finally, there is a threat of extinction of the existence of the
individual himself. Death comes upon oneself.

These are the fears of the psyche, which have a basis and a truthfulness in the sense that they
indicate the possibility of the existence of some realm where these insecure conditions are
overcome completely.

The truths of life seem to be in several layers of self-transcendence, one rising above the
other, and the lower does not satisfy until the next higher one is reached. We can never be satisfied
with anything in this world because satisfaction cannot arise from that which is totally outside us.
The outsideness of the values of life and the objects supposed to bring us satisfaction defeats the
very attempt at acquiring any kind of permanent joy and satisfaction in this world. That from which
we seek satisfaction, namely the objects of sense, are incapable of contact by the perceiver because
of the fact that they are outside. We have already dubbed the world as something totally external to
us, unconnected with us, and therefore, we can expect nothing from the world. Nevertheless, man
runs after the pleasures of life in the form of contact with objects which are totally outside. Here is a
contradiction in the very operation of desire itself. It is a self-defeating attempt of what we call
human desire.

Desire is the longing to possess that which is not within oneself, but which is outside. But
the outsideness of the object prevents its coming in contact with the experiencing consciousness. So
every desire ends in tragedy, frustration and utter defeat, and no one ever goes from this world with
the satisfaction that the attempt has succeeded. Everything is lost. The conclusion of the old man
who is about to depart is that the whole life has become futile, and there is no value or worth in
anything, because he has lived a life of pursuing that which one cannot expect in a world that is
totally outside.

The religious ideal is not based on the concept of the externality of the world, or the
internality of anything. The world is neither outside us, nor is it inside. We are integrally related to
the world; so is the case with the world in respect of our own selves. We are not sitting outside the
world, we are in the world, but not inside the world as something contained in a pot. The
relationship between the individual and the cosmos is of an organic whole. To put it in a more plain
way, we may say it is something like the organs of the body getting related to the bodily organism
itself. Though the hand and the feet can be perceived by oneself as objects of sense, they do not
remain as external objects. They are organic parts of the whole body, which is the transcendence of
the limbs. Thus, religion rises above the classical scientific notion of the externality of the world
and touches upon what we may call the universal concept of the truth of life.

80

IS MODERN SCIENCE A CHALLENGE TO RELIGION?

The Truth, which is the ultimate aim of the religious pursuit, is an all-comprehensive
universal inclusiveness, and here it does not go hand in hand with classical physics which requires
the world to be totally outside. The clash between physical science in its classical form and the
religious ideal lies in this fact that on one side it is asserted that the fact of life is a universal
inclusiveness; on the other side, it is asserted that it is totally outside.

Later, towards the middle of the twentieth century, the theories of science got modified
systematically, and more considerate and investigative scientists found that it is impossible to know
anything unless there is a relationship between the knower and the known. A totally disconnected
object, as the world is, cannot be known by any individual consciousness. The involvement of the
object of perception in the subjective operation of visualising is necessary in order that perception
can take place at all. There must be an en rapport between the perceiving consciousness and the
perceived object. The two stand parallel to each other. Neither is the world above the individual, nor
is the individual above the world. They are coeval in time and space. We are of the same stuff as the
world is made of, and we are living in a realm which is just the physical realm of the five elements.
The world is a constitution of the five physical elements,(cid:151)earth, water, fire, air, and ether, which
also are the building bricks of the individual body. The very substance of our physical existence is
the same as the substance of the physical world. The building bricks of the cosmos are the building
bricks of our own personalities. Then, if that is the case, what is it that makes us feel that we are
different from the world? It is an interference of a particular unintelligible phenomenon called
space and time. Though classical physics from the point of view of Newton considered that space
and time have nothing to do with the contents of the world, it was later discovered that space and
time are vitally connected with every physical event in the world.

It is in the Taittiriya Upanishad that we hear of the evolutionary process of the cosmos.
Tasmadva etasmadatmana akashah sambhutah: From the Universal Absolute, the Selfhood of the
cosmos, space emanated. Here, we must realise that even space has a connection with the Absolute.
Akashadvayuh; The principle of air emanated from the vibrations of space. Vayoragnih; Friction
created by the movement of air created heat, which is fire. Agnerapah; The condensation of the heat
of fire produced the liquid condition of the world, which is water. The solidification of water
became the earth principle, Adbhyah prithivi. Prithivya oshadhayah: From the earth arise all herbs,
plants and trees, which are the foodstuff of animals and human beings. Oshadhibhyannam; All that
we eat arises from the plants and trees and vegetables and such edible articles produced by the earth.
Annatpurushah; The human arises as a latecomer in the process of evolution. This physical body is
annamaya, constituted of the foodstuff which is the earth principle, which again is an evolutionary
consequence of the water principle, that again of the fire principle, the fire principle of the air
principle, the air principle of the space principle, and the space principle is rooted in the Universal
Existence.

So, you can know your connection with the Ultimate Reality. We are sunk deep in Ultimate
Being. We are an automatic evolute in the lowest form of its expression, in its physical, material
form, which is the spatio-temporal expression of the non-spatial and non-temporal Supreme Being
which is Ultimate Consciousness: satyam jnanamanantam brahma.

Lofty is this concept. Today, the more understanding type of physical scientists have
practically stumbled upon this great concept of the Upanishads. Mathematicians who declared that

81

GOD EXISTS

the world is only equations, point events, and waves of probability, or a continuum of some
indescribable stuff which is incapable of description, have inadvertently been forced to accept that
existence is indivisible. This conclusion should be drawn by the consciousness of the scientist
himself.

The great physicist, Sir Arthur Eddington, who would not accept that there is God or such a
thing as consciousness, fell upon this acceptance inadvertently, unconsciously, as it were. In his
great book (cid:147)The Nature of the Physical World,(cid:148) he utters gospel truth: (cid:147)The stuff of the world is
consciousness.(cid:148)

Science misunderstood is a threat to religion; if you consider it only as a technological
process of flying with great speed, and working through satellite, television and internet, that would
be a poor concept of science. Science is noble investigative procedure, which can take us to the
depths of the secrets of life, if dispassionately we go with it.

Here is an unexpected discovery of science that the stuff of the world has to be
consciousness. Why is it so? It is because the world has to be known in order that it may be accepted
to exist. Who is telling you that the world is existing? Your consciousness is telling this. How does
the consciousness know that the world is existing, unless this consciousness is pervading the world
of perception? The imbibition of the very structure of the physical world into the structure of
consciousness is the reason why we believe in the existence of a world, and that it is outside. So,
there is finally no conflict between the highest discoveries of science and the noble aspirations of
religion.

By (cid:147)religion(cid:148) we are not meaning Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism,(cid:151)this (cid:147)ism,(cid:148) that
(cid:147)ism,(cid:148) and all that. These are all designated denominational forms of the true meaning of religion.
Religion is the aspiration of the soul for its ultimate destiny. It is a search of the individual for the
Absolute. It is a longing of the spirit within us for God Almighty. It has nothing to do with any
(cid:147)ism,(cid:148) and no one can be free from this eternal longing for perfection, which may better be called
spiritual aspiration rather than a religious longing, because of the abuse of the word (cid:147)religion(cid:148) in
modern times, under historical circumstances, and in the studies in schools and colleges.

People who are now considering themselves as scientists and very advanced in logical
thinking pooh-pooh religion, thinking that it is an old grandmother(cid:146)s story, because their idea of
religion is so poor, as is their concept of science. There is a tragedy that has befallen every one of us
in our not being able to be precise in our knowledge of things, whether it is scientific or religious.

There is no conflict. There was a time in the Middle Ages when physical science appeared to
be clashing with the theological doctrines of the church. The church excommnunicated many
scientists, and they were punished with severe indictments from the Pope. An inquisition was set up
in the Middle Ages,(cid:151)for us, very unthinkable, indeed. People were burnt, thrown into the flames
by dogmatic religious followers, and science retaliated and disconnected itself from the Pope.

Today we are in a different world altogether. The conflict has ceased; at least, it is appearing
to be ceasing. Though it was once said, (cid:147)The East is East and the West is West, and the twain shall
never meet,(cid:148) I think today it is attempting to come together, and is meeting. The West and the East

IS MODERN SCIENCE A CHALLENGE TO RELIGION?

wish to shake hands with each other and accept their common heritage as human beings, rather than
Westerners and Easterners, scientists and religious followers, seekers of God and seekers of
material values.

There are several textbooks written these days, where powerful monograph have gone into
the depths of this harmony that is already existing between the external and the universal. Though
the external may be different from the internal, it cannot be external to the universal. The universal
is a transcendent element which rises above both the subjective side and the objective side. We
cannot even know that there is anything outside us unless there is a third element which is not
ourselves, and not the object that is perceived, also.

Because of the externality of the object of perception and the internality of consciousness,
there is no connection between the two, and knowledge is impossible; no one can know that
anything is. But there is a transcendent principle. Eastern thought considers this as adhidaiva, a
spiritual principle operating as a transcendental element,(cid:151)unknown and unperceivable, but
operating between the subjective side and the objective side.

The subjective side is called the adhyatma,

the objective is adhibhauta, and the
transcendent is adhidaiva. All the three have to work together in order that there may be perception
at all. But we are so poor in our understanding that we know little of ourselves, and much less of the
world, and nothing at all of this transcendental operation. Gods are behind our eyes and ears, our
nose and tongue, and our sensations. These gods which are the denizens of heaven are the operators
of this mechanism called the physical body with its sense organs. It is a presumption on the part of
the egoistic individual to think that he or she is working. The workers are the great divine beings
which are transcendent adhidaivas,(cid:151)gods in heaven, as we call them. But they are invisible. They
are invisible because they are neither inside nor outside; they are (cid:147)above.(cid:148)

Here is a path-finding direction for both science and religion, so that if they work together in
harmony they can create a world of joy and satisfaction that life is worth living. Do you want to
depart from this world with the tragic feeling that nothing has been achieved? The world has eluded
the grasp of everybody. Kings have come, empires rose and fell, and the earth has not changed. It
appears to be so because of our wrong evaluation of the historical process. History is actually a
natural process of the cosmos. It is the total operation taking place in the whole of creation, even
when a little event is taking place somewhere in a corner of the world. Our learned speaker
mentioned about quantum mechanics and the discoveries of relativity, etc., which highlighted the
astounding truth of sudden and simultaneous action taking place in the universe. Every event is a
simultaneous event. It is not taking place yesterday and tomorrow; it is just now, everywhere.

Did not the poet tell us that we cannot touch the petals of a flower in our garden without
disturbing the stars in the heavens? It is not poetry; it is the truth. Every event is a universal event.
Anything that is taking place anywhere takes place everywhere, and we are living throughout the
universe, in all parts of the cosmos. Our individuality is not confined merely to this earth planet. It is
everywhere in different parts.

Scientists today have discovered the possibility of worlds within worlds, and the possibility
of many worlds, and our being inhabitants of all these worlds simultaneously. (cid:147)Simultaneously(cid:148) is

83

GOD EXISTS

the word we have to underline. We are not inhabiting these many worlds in succession,(cid:151)today
here, tomorrow somewhere else. At one stroke, in a timeless manner, we inhabit the whole cosmos,
and we are world citizens working in different forms. Unknown to our own selves, one part of
ourselves is here on this earth performing activities in this way, and another part of our own
archetypal nature is in the heaven, even today.

Our higher self in the heaven is pulling us and summoning us: (cid:147)Come on. You are not here,
where you appear to be. You are in the heaven.(cid:148) That is why we are longing for the higher values of
life, and we can never be satisfied; we are always unsatisfied because we are not in this world. We
are really in some other world,(cid:151)not only in some other world, we are in all the worlds. This
universal operation of individuals is a great discovery of modern Quantum Mechanics, which is
quite different from that science which appears to be in conflict with religion. Science has become
spirituality; physics has become metaphysics.

This is a wonder toward the end of the twentieth century that we are seeing; we believe that
God shall come. The kingdom of heaven is within us; it is within us, because it is everywhere. How
can a large kingdom be contained within our little frame of physical existence? It is because the
inwardness of our existence is not actually the physical inwardness. The whole universe can be
within us.

It is the Chandogya Upanishad which tells us that whatever is happening in the outside
world is happening within us. If the sun is shining there, it is shining inside, also. If it is hot outside,
it is hot inside, also. If it is raining outside, it is raining inside, also. If there is thunder there, there is
thunder here, also. But we are so stupid that we cannot realise these events are taking place within
us, commensurate with all the things that are happening outside in the world.

We are the world; thus, the discovery of science today tells us. This is what the great Yoga
Vasishtha scripture tells us. This is what the Upanishads tell us. It is not merely the twain of West
and East that is coming together; God and man are shaking hands with each other in this vast
kingdom of universal creation.
