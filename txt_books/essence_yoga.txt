UNIVERSAL PRAYER

Thou art, O Lord! The creator of this universe. Thou art the protector of this world. Thou art
in the grass and the rose. Thou art in the sun and the stars. Salutations unto Thee! O bestower of joy
and bliss!

O Sweet Lord! Let me be free from the clutches of death. Let me be able to look upon all
beings with equal vision. Let me be free from impurity and sin. Give me strength to control the
mind. Give me strength to serve Thee and the humanity untiringly. Make me Thy fit instrument for
Thy work. Make me pure and strong.

I bow to Thee, O Indweller of many hearts! O Secret of secrets! Remove my weaknesses,
defects and evil thoughts. Make me pure so that I may be able to receive Thy grace and blessings. O
Lord! Thou art the thread-soul that connects all beings. Thou pervadest all, permeatest and
interpenetratest all things of this universe.

Thou art light divine. Thou art the dispeller of ignorance. Thou art All-merciful Lord. Give

me a life without disease. Let me remember Thee always. Let me develop all sublime virtues.

Thou art Self-luminous. Thou art my father, mother, brother, friend, relative and guide. Let
me realise the Truth. Let me be free from greed, lust, egoism, jealousy and hatred. Prepare me as
Thy sweet messenger on this earth so that I may radiate joy, peace and bliss to the whole world. Let
me utilise this body, mind and senses in Thy service and the service of Thy creatures. Breathe into
me Thy breath of Immortality. Let me recognise the universal brotherhood of man. Let me love all
as my own self. Salutations unto Thee, O Lord of compassion.

PRAYER TO THE MOTHER

Salutations to the Divine Mother who exists in all beings in the form of intelligence, mercy
and beauty. Salutations, O Sweet Mother the consort of Lord Siva! O Mother Parvati! Thou art
Lakshmi. Thou art Sarasvati. Thou art Kali, Durga and Kundalini. Thou art the embodiment of all
power. Thou art Para Sakti. Thou art in the form of all objects. Thou art the sole refuge of all. Thou
hast enchanted the world. The whole universe is the play of Thy three Gunas. How can I praise
Thee? Thy glory is indescribable. Thy splendour is ineffable. Protect me. Guide me, O Loving
Mother!

O Adorable Mother! Thou hast generated this great illusion by which all people walk
deluded in this world. All sciences have come from Thee. Without Thy grace no one can get success
in spiritual Sadhana and salvation in the end. Thou art the seed for this world. Thou hast two
aspects, viz., the unmanifested aspect or Avyaktam and the manifested aspect or the gross universe.
The whole world gets dissolved in Avyaktam during Pralaya. Give me the divine eye. Let me
behold Thy real majestic form. Help me to cross over this illusion, O Kind Mother!

iv

O Compassionate Mother! I bow to Thee. Thou art my saviour. Thou art my goal. Thou art
my sole support. Thou art my guide and the remover of all afflictions, troubles and miseries. Thou
art the embodiment of auspiciousness. Thou pervadeth the whole universe. The whole universe is
filled with Thee. Thou art the storehouse of all qualities. Do Thou protect me. I again and again
salute Thee; O glorious Mother! Salutations to Thee. All women are Thy parts. Mind, egoism,
intellect, body, Prana and senses are Thy forms. Thou art Para-Prakriti and Apara-Prakriti. Thou art
electricity, magnetism, force, energy, power and will. All forms are Thy forms only. Reveal to me
the mystery of creation. Bestow on me the divine knowledge.

O Loving Mother! Thou art the primal energy, Thou hast two aspects, viz., the terrible and
the peaceful. Thou art modesty, gentleness, shyness, generosity, courage, forbearance and patience.
Thou art faith in the heart of devotees and nobility in noble people, chivalry in warriors and ferocity
in tigers. Give me strength to control the mind and the Indriyas. Make me worthy to dwell in Thee!
Salutation unto Thee!

O Mother Supreme! When shall I have equal vision and a placid state of mind? When shall I
be established in Ahimsa, Satyam and Brahmacharya? When shall I get deep abiding peace and
perennial joy? When shall I enter in deep meditation and Samadhi?

O Radiant Mother! I have not done any spiritual Sadhana or service of teachers. I have not
practised any Vrata, pilgrimage, charity, Japa and meditation or worship. I have not studied
religious scriptures. I have neither purity nor a burning yearning for liberation. Thou art my only
refuge. Thou art my only support. My silent adoration unto Thee! I am Thy meek supplicant.
Remove the veil of ignorance.

Gracious Mother! Prostrations unto Thee. Where art Thou? Do not forsake me. I am Thy
child. Take me to the other shore of fearlessness and joy. When shall I behold Thy lotus-feet with
my own eyes? Thou art the boundless ocean of mercy. When the philosopher(cid:146)s stone turns iron into
gold by contact, when the Ganga turns impure water into pure water, can(cid:146)st Thou not turn me, O
Mother Divine, into a pure Soul? May my tongue repeat Thy Name always!

PURPOSE OF LIFE

The life of man is an indication of what is beyond him and what determines the course of his
thoughts, feelings and actions. The wider life is invisible, and the visible is a shadow cast by the
invisible which is the real. The shadow gives an idea of the substance, and one can pursue the path
to the true substance by the perception of the shadow. Human existence, by the fact of its
limitations, wants and various forms of restlessness, discontent and sorrow, points to a higher
desired end, incomprehensible though the nature of this end be.

As life on this earth is characterised by incessant change, and nothing here seems to have the
character of reality, nothing here can satisfy man completely. The Bhagavad Gita has referred to
this world as anityam, asukham, duhkhalayam, ashashvatam(cid:151)(cid:148)Impermanent, unhappy, the abode
of sorrow, transient(cid:148). The sages of yore declared with immediate realisation that (cid:147)Truth is One(cid:148) and
that the goal of human life is the realisation and the experience of this Truth.

The universe is inconstant, and it is only a field of experience provided to the individuals so
that they may evolve towards the experience of the Highest Truth. It is the glory of the people of
Bharatavarsha (India) that to them the visible universe is not real and the invisible Eternal alone is
real. They have no faith in what they perceive with the senses. They have faith only in that which is
the ground of all experience, beyond the senses, beyond even the individual mind.

Earnest seekers used to seek shelter under great sages who purified the holy region of the
Himalayas with their mighty presence, and lived the austere life of Yogis in order to attain freedom
from the trammels of earth-bound life and rest in the beatitude of the Absolute, Brahman. This they
considered the true life, and thus the way of fulfilling the law of the Eternal.

The great law-giver Manu, after describing the various tenets of Dharma, finally asserts:
(cid:147)Of all these Dharmas, the Knowledge of the Self is the highest; it is verily the foremost of all
sciences; for, by it, one attains immortality.(cid:148) The pursuit of Dharma, Artha and Kama has its
meaning in the attainment of Moksha which is the greatest of all the Purusharthas (end of human
life). Dharma is the ethical and moral value of life; Artha is its material value; and Kama is its vital
value; but Moksha is the infinite value of existence which covers all the others and is itself far
greater than all these. Others exist as aids or preparations for Moksha. Without Moksha, they have
no value and convey no meaning. Their value is conditioned by the law of the Infinite, which is the
same as Moksha.

The Vedas and the Upanishads are the exhalations of the Divine Being, and they give an
exhaustive commentary on spiritual life. They are expositions of the significance and the import of
human life and of the method of the transmutation of the mortal appearance into the Immortal
Essence. The instance of the great Nachiketas and the story of his adventurous search for Truth
narrated in the thrilling Kathopanishad serve as exemplars to all men capable of thought and
reflection.

Nothing of the world of sensibility can be of real value(cid:151)this is what Nachiketas taught
through his memorable act of renunciation. Not even the longest life and the immense wealth
offered to him could tempt him. He persevered in his quest for the Highest, and in the end achieved

vi

the Highest. Nothing short of it could satisfy him. Such are the true heroes. A real hero is not he who
stands against bullets or risks his life in hazardous attempts, fights battles, dives into oceans and
climbs high cliffs, but he who subdues his senses and overcomes his mind, recognises the supreme
unity of life and casts aside dualities and desires. To achieve this is the duty of man; this is the
immortal message of the sages of the Upanishads.

The tangle of sense-experience in which man is caught is most vexing, and hard it is to free
oneself from it. Man is deluded by the notion of the reality of the so-called external relations of
things and thus he comes to grief. The Mahabharata says that the contact of beings in this universe is
like the contact of logs of wood in a flowing river, temporary. Yet the attachment to sense-percepts
is so strong that phantoms are mistaken for facts, the impure is mistaken for the pure, the painful for
the pleasant, and the not-self for the Self.

The message of the ancient sages is that the life one lives in the sense-world is deceptive, for
it hides the Existence underlying all things and makes one feel that the particular presentation of
forms before the senses alone is real. (cid:147)Children run after external pleasures and fall into the net of
wide-spread death. The heroes, however, knowing the Immortal, seek not the Eternal among things
unstable here,(cid:148) says the Upanishad. The call of the ancient sages to man is: (cid:147)O son of the Immortal!
Know yourself as the Infinite! become the All. This is the supreme blessing. This is the supreme
bliss.(cid:148) This is the undying message to man.

The sages have again and again stressed: (cid:147)If one knows It (i.e., the Immortal Being) here,
then there is the true end of all aspirations! If one does not know It here, great is the loss for him.(cid:148)
(Kenopanishad). And sage Yajnavalkya says that all great deeds done in this world, without the
knowledge of the One Imperishable Being, are not worth anything. Humanitarian services; fasts
and charity; one(cid:146)s political, national, social and individual life; should all be based on the feeling of
universal brotherhood which is the eternal expression of the Reality of universal Selfhood.

Humanity can hope for peace when this condition, discovered and laid down by the Rishis,
viz., abiding by the law of the Divine is fulfilled. Peace can be had only to the extent that the system
of the Divine is adhered to in life. And this peace is inversely proportional to the love of body,
individuality and its relations in the world, in which humanity is generally steeped. An (cid:145)awakening(cid:146)
of a higher consciousness is necessary so that disorder and discontent may be abolished.

Education of humanity in the right direction is the precondition of world peace.
Materialism, atheism, scepticism and agnosticism which are rampant in these days and which have
robbed man of his reverence for the Supreme Absolute are mainly responsible for the increasing
selfishness, craving, confusion, violence and agitation of mind that are seething in the world. Man
should learn that behind the appearance of materiality, discreteness, externality, doubt and
impermanence, there is the reality of spirituality, unity and infinity.

Without the recognition of this reality, life loses life and becomes an emptiness, devoid of
meaning and purpose, dead, as it were. To live in the divine is to die to the narrowness of the sense
world; and to be confined to the latter is to (cid:145)destroy oneself(cid:146) (in the words of the Isavasyopanishad).
The present trend of life has to be overhauled, and a reorientation in it brought about in the light of

vii

morality, ethics and spirituality. The change that is required is not merely in the outward form but in
the very perspective and the inner constitution of the system of living.

This can be done when man(cid:146)s ideals are based on the truths of the spirituality of Oneness,
lifted above blind beliefs, differences and materiality. When this is achieved, man would have
fulfilled his great duty here. For the man scorched in the waterless desert of worldliness, the only
hope is in the cool waters of the Ganga of wisdom, flowing from the Himalayan heights of the sages
of the Upanishads. Drink from this perennial fount, and refresh yourself.

THE SPIRIT OF INDIAN SPIRITUAL INHERITANCE

The true greatness of Indian spiritual inheritance consists in the secret and glorious methods
it has delivered to us for allaying life(cid:146)s sorrow and human unhappiness and for acquiring for the
circumstance of human existence, the infinite peace and perfection of the Divine Being. Human
grief cannot be alleviated as long as the human individual is immured in ignorance and strives
merely for his individual pleasure and good. The genius of India has, to its immortal honour, soared
above the conventional ties and the bonds of society, grasped the spiritual truth, realised it and
proclaimed to the world, for the welfare of all mankind, that (cid:147)Life is One(cid:148) and not many. Apart
from the petty disharmonies between one person and another, the nations of the world seem to be
separated from each other and this virulent notion of division and separation is the mother of war
and destruction. Deceived by the spectacular advancement of scientific knowledge, modern mind
in all countries and continents has not cared to understand the fundamental meaning of life, and
sought its satisfaction in a sensational floating upon the apparently attractive scum of Existence.
Such has been the spirit in which science has taken its marvellous strides in progress, that it has
nothing in its constitution to drive it towards a grasp of the deep and significant changes that man
undergoes beneath his scalp, towards understanding the potentialities of man as a mind, as a heart,
as a spirit, as a creative entity, towards directing his aspirations, towards aiding the blossoming of
the noblest forces that lie buried and latent in his bosom. Redounding to the eternal credit of the
genius of India, there lies the momentous fact that at the very dawn of civilisations, it has raised the
deepest issues of life, questioned the limitations of human existence, ventured forth for a solution
into the realms of that Infinite Power that is found (cid:145)feebly(cid:146) interpenetrating this world of physics,
physical experience, materialistic philosophy and (cid:145)sputniks,(cid:146) discovered that guiding, governing
and sustaining Permanent Ground upon which is played the tragi-comic drama of life and the pride
of men that are dressed in brief authority. If there is anything valuable in life as a whole, it is the
knowledge of the solution of the apparent riddle of existence, the knowledge of the essential nature
and the real destiny of man, the knowledge of man(cid:146)s real relations to the other men, to the universe,
to the Transcendence, and this knowledge is the glorious heritage of India. The men of India who
are also the men of God, men who have imposed upon themselves the disciplines that lead them to
Perfection, to living the good life, the ideal life, the divine life, the life in the inner Reality and for
the happiness of mankind, for the solidarity of the world, have discovered the road to Success and
Achievement, discerned the clues to progress and perfection, in a strict adherence to the rhythms of
the universal laws and the eternal verities that guide in accordance to the genius inherent in them,
humanity as a whole and all manifestation to the final denouement in a Divine Existence.

viii

The attitude of life which the Indians developed was based upon the nature of the End or the
Goal to be attained through the instrumentality of the phenomenon of life(cid:151)life which is a step, a
stage, and not the end in itself. This attitude ensouls the righteous law, the Dharma, and to it, the
universe becomes what it intrinsically is, the Dharma-Kshetra, or the arena for the display and the
justification of the prowess of the right action, the action whose whole spirit moves towards the
realisation of the absolute Good that is the nature of the Infinite Being. The ideal of Dharma forms
the substratum upon which is built the structure of the whole life of man who wishes to resolve the
riddle of his personal life, win victory over the struggle of existence, be crowned with a strange and
ethereal joy even while he is living in the environment of the world, of this imperfect earth that is
the heir to change, sorrow, and death. Dharma is virtue and virtue is that which leads one to the most
perfect condition, the condition that is identical with the ultimate success constituted of the joy of
life, unlimited, unfettered and unalloyed, complete beyond expression. As the highest virtue that
man may practise, Ahimsa is both a negative withdrawal and a positive assertion of the (cid:145)mind(cid:146). It is
refraining from doing, speaking and thinking anything which will cause pain and sorrow to any
other individual, to any living being. This represents the negative aspect of the discipline of
Ahimsa. Its positive aspect is brought out by an expression of universal love, love that has no
partiality, love that excludes nothing, love that cares not for the effect of love! The ideal of universal
love is a spontaneous self-fulfilment in the delight of a discovery of Oneself, of the universally
self-same, our own inner consciousness in all. Until this is done, no civilization is genuine, no
culture is true, nothing is perfect and lasting. In one word, it is in the light of absolute Conciousness
which is undifferentiated that Ahimsa which is more a matter of spirit than an effect of a mere act, is
practised.

Immediately succeeding the devotion to the principle of Ahimsa, comes the practice of the
excellence of truth. To the spiritual genius, Truth is more than truth-speaking; it is God or the
Absolute; it is that which triumphs, not untruth. Again, Truth is right; untruth is wrong; that which
elevates one and takes one nearer to God is right, that which brings one down and takes one away
from God is wrong. And that God towards which our whole inner being must rise, in the indivisible
unity of conscious existence, the infinity of delight and awareness. Control over passions
constitutes the essence of truth; self-denial or refraining from greedy indulgence is truth; to permit
the spiritual element in us triumph is truth. Truth is a life in the eternal. Untruth is change, decay and
death. Love is truth; hatred is untruth; harmony is truth; disharmony is untruth. There is no greater
sin than hatred and battle(cid:151)the pungent word and the insolent action, the arrogance and the
uncharitableness, the egoistic self-assertion and vehement action of the selfish impulse. Relative
truths are valid only insofar as they do not run against the grain of absolute truth which is the Eternal
in the highest sense.

The third canon is the self-control which is the holding in check of the instinctive urges that
try to drag the individual away from the experience of the truth. Self-control is a universal rule
unexceptionally applicable to all men and all women, at all places and at all times. It is the very key
to beatitude. Indulgence in externalities, in sensuous objects, in physical pleasures is the effect of
the failure of the individual to discriminate the spiritual value from the material chaff, the Truth
from the untruth. Desire to have contact with and enjoy outward things is the outcome of the
ignorance of the Truth that is God, the Truth that is the Infinite Existence. Self-control is the
restraint of the outgoing tendencies of the senses and the mind and to centre the same in the active
participation of Truth-existence,
this energization of

the Universal One. This self-control,

ix

consciousness, this Tapas, this restraining of one(cid:146)s externalising, self-diffusing energies and
founding oneself upon that one Cosmic Being is Dharma that supports the life and law of the
universe, integrates the being of man, and spreads before the vision of man the creative
God-centred life. Adharma is selfishness and egoism of nature which leads to self-imprisonment,
suffering and failure in life. Absolute righteousness means the sacrifice of the self for universal
well-being, the well-being pertaining not merely to the earth but to the highest spiritual reality, the
well-being of keeping the Consciousness in its poise liberated from the distraction engendered by
the darkness of ignorance, separativencss, division, limitedness. It is the opposite of (cid:147)I(cid:148)-ness and
(cid:147)mine(cid:148)-ness which belong to the nature of the world of bondage.

Life on earth is not self-sufficient and, hence, there is perpetual flux of states to reach other
states of superior knowledge and happiness. Life in this world and in this body is only a preparation,
a step for the higher life. That which we see and hear of is not the real; the Real is beyond this. To
reach the Real, the present life acts as a ladder, a field of activity that affords the conditions and the
scope for the individual to establish its relations with the most exalted Divine Life. Wrong it is to
restrict the outlook of our life to the perceptible phenomena and to judge our sense of values in
relation to the objective worth of things. The grandeur and greatness of our life rests upon the
measure to which we have raised ourselves into the law of inmost life in general, in the Supreme
Being. Dealings with one another are justified only so long as they do not deviate from the eternal
law of the Spiritual Nature. Neither social welfare nor national betterment is possible by mere
clinging to shadows and forgetting the essential Substance. The substance of Truth does not belong
to any particular person for it is the being and life of whatever that is. That which is One and
Common can only be divisionless and all-inclusive in a self-identical existence. This is the fulness
of attainment and the culmination of all the aspirations and ideals of life.

In this integral spiritual view of life is rooted the ethical basis of social and domestic
relationship. Society is the collective body of individuals determined to pierce the veils and enter
the realms of Immortal Being with the power of a unified and common aspiration and struggle to
grasp the Highest. Unified we live; divided we cease to live. Human relationship is not meant to
signify anything less than the attempt to live in everyday life the spiritual egoless love that is at the
background of all existent beings. The love of the Self means the love of everything of the universe.
The Indian genius would complete the teaching (cid:147)Love thy neighbour as thyself(cid:148) by adding
(cid:147)because thy neighbour is thy own Self(cid:148). Altruistic love is the expression of eternal unison of the
Infinite Life that lies at the depth of the universe. If family or society or nation is understood as a
means to separate one from another, however much large the scope of its inclusion of human beings
may be, such a family, such a society, such a nation, cannot triumph. All relationship is expected to
end in the absolute unity of existence excluding nothing from itself. This goal of life should be
borne in mind in the process of daily activities if our actions are to be free from selfishness, at one
with the universal movement of Nature. Life is a divine worship. The proper conduct of family, the
administration of the country and the society is a part of the Universal Government which looks at
the entirety of beings with a strictly impartial eye. We live because God exists and our life is to be
perfect and just even as God is perfect and just. We exist in God(cid:146)s Being, we breathe and move in
Him.

x

The knowledge of this unity of life and the proper moral and the ethical attitude required to
start the process of realising it are achieved through being directly instructed by the teacher who is
truly advanced in knowledge and has attained Self-perfection.

The psychology of Gurukulavasa is inseparably connected with the science of
self-discipline and Self-knowledge. It is not the mechanical education of the present day that is
meant by real education in the Gurukula, but the means of erasing out the propensities that cloud the
awareness of the Truth and controlling the distractive nature of the psyche. Self-mastery is the
effect of the protracted checking of the ego-sense and centring of it in the General God-Being which
is egoless, free from the sense of individual existence. The religion, the philosophy, the code of
ethical and social law of India are all universal in their character. Universality is the expression of
the nature of the Reality. The highest universal science of the Truth is the Vedanta in which are
blended together the different existent views of life. The Vedanta is neither a sect nor a creed, but
the science of the Absolute Reality, the only life-giving science, the only solace to the intelligent
mankind.

The boldest proclamation of Vedanta is that man is in essence infinitely Divine, that
everyone is bound to succeed sooner or later, that all are bound to recover themselves in the Infinite
Life Divine. The ideal of the Vedanta is not merely a universal brotherhood nor merely living a
united and happy social life in the world of differentiated individuals, but the being of the Absolute
Essence of the Highest Divinity which is the Life, Source and End of the Universe. The Vedanta is
the master-technique of transmuting the many into the Undivided One. It means Experience Whole
and existing as the birthless and deathless Infinite. This is the greatest heritage of India, this is the
greatest treasure that India has and this is the greatest gift that India can offer to the world. This is
the zenith of culture and civilization, this is the highest knowledge that man can ever attempt to
acquire, this is the final fruition of the best of human aspiration.

The

of
Absolute-Experience, of Truth-realisation, or a poised awareness of the Infinite here on earth, in
this life, in the environment of the dance and pageantry of finitude, relativity, objectivity. As the
dwelling place of the Rishis, the Sages, the Men of God-Vision, India enjoys in the estimation of the
world a unique prerogative.

India

upon

the

of

All the grand ideals of world(cid:146)s great religions that have moulded the characters of men, the
loftiest tenets of ethics and morality that have raised human beings to the magnanimous height of
supreme perfection and all the sublime truths of spirituality that have made man divine and have
shaped the spiritual life of nations and of the saviours of mankind, first took their origins in India,
the land of those daring spiritual individuals who entered into the heart of the Absolute and
proclaimed truths which have eternal values. With its spiritual horizons lit up with the deathless
light of the Upanishadic wisdom, India is essentially a land of spiritual wealth, and its history is the
history of religious experience. The Goal of India is Self-realisation or the attainment of
God-Consciousness through the express manifestation of a spirit of renunciative detachment and
through a dynamic divine knowledge. If men are but to understand the significance and the richness
of this spiritual inheritance of India, and make the spirit of this heritage part and parcel of their daily
awareness, they all would be veritable gods on earth.

Chapter I

YOGA

YOGA

Yoga is a perfect practical system of self-culture. Yoga is an exact science. It aims at the
harmonious development of the body, the mind and the soul. Yoga is the turning away of the senses
from the objective universe and the concentration of the mind within. Yoga is eternal life in the soul
or spirit. Yoga aims at controlling the mind and its modifications. The path of Yoga is an inner path
whose gateway is your heart.

Yoga is the discipline of the mind, senses and physical body. Yoga helps in the
co-ordination and control of the subtle forces within the body. Yoga brings in perfection, peace and
everlasting happiness. Yoga can help you in your business and in your daily life. You can have
calmness of mind at all times by the practice of Yoga. You can have restful sleep. You can have
increased energy, vigour, vitality, longevity and a high standard of health. Yoga transmutes animal
nature into divine nature and raises you to the pinnacle of divine glory and splendour.

The practice of Yoga will help you to control the emotions and passions and will give you
power to resist temptations and to remove the disturbing elements form mind. It will enable you to
keep a balanced mind always and remove fatigue. It will confer on you serenity, calmness and
wonderful concentration. It will enable you to hold communion with the Lord and thus attain the
summum bonum of existence.

If you want to attain success in Yoga, you will have to abandon all worldly enjoyments and
practise Tapas and Brahmacharya. You will have to control the mind skilfully and tactfully. You
will have to use judicious and intelligent methods to curb it. If you use force, it will become more
turbulent and mischievous. It cannot be controlled by force. It will jump and drift away more and
more. Those who attempt to control the mind by force are like those who endeavour to bind a
furious elephant with a thin silken thread.

A Guru or preceptor is indispensable for the practice of Yoga. The aspirant in the path of
Yoga should be humble, simple, gentle, refined, tolerant, merciful and kind. If you have a curiosity
to get psychic powers, you cannot have success in Yoga. Yoga does not consist in sitting
cross-legged for six hours or stopping the pulse or beatings of the heart or getting oneself buried
underneath the ground for a week or a month.

Self-sufficiency, impertinence, pride, luxury, name, fame, self-assertive nature, obstinacy,
idea of superiority, sensual desires, evil company, laziness, overeating, overwork, too much mixing
and too much talking are some of the obstacles in the path of Yoga. Admit your faults freely. When
you are free from all these evil traits, Samadhi or union will come by itself.

1

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Practise Yama and Niyama. Sit comfortably in Padma or Siddhasana. Restrain the breath.
Withdraw the senses. Control the thoughts. Concentrate. Meditate and attain Asamprajnata or
Nirvikalpa Samadhi (union with the Supreme Self).

May you shine as a brilliant Yogi by the practice of Yoga! May you enjoy the bliss of the

Eternal!

ESSENCE OF KARMA YOGA

Karma Yoga is selfless service unto humanity. (cid:147)Your duty is to work incessantly but not to

expect the fruits thereof.(cid:148) This is the central teaching of the Gita.

Repeat your Ishtamantra mentally even when you work in office. God is the Inner Ruler. He
directs the body, mind and senses to work. Become an instrument in the hands of the Lord. Do not
expect thanks or appreciation for your work. Do actions as your duty and offer them and their fruits
to the Lord. You will be freed from the bonds of Karma. It is not the Karma but the selfish motive
that binds the man.

Never, never say, (cid:147)I have helped that man.(cid:148) Feel and think, (cid:147)That man gave me an
opportunity to serve. This piece of service has helped me to purify my mind. I am extremely
grateful to him.(cid:148) If you see a poor man clad in rags standing in front of your door, feel that the Lord
is before you in the form of a poor man. Serve him with Narayana Bhava.

Never grumble when you do service to others. Take delight in service. Watch for

opportunities, to serve. Never miss even a single opportunity. Work is worship of the Lord.

A Karma Yogi should have an amiable, loving, social nature. He should have sympathy,
adaptability, self-restraint, tolerance, love and mercy. He should adjust himself to the ways and
habits of others. He should be able to bear insult, harsh words, criticism, pleasure and pain, heat and
cold.

You can do selfless service according to your ability and station in life. An advocate can
plead for poor people without accepting fees. A doctor can treat the poor free of charge. A teacher or
professor can give free tution to poor boys. He can supply them books for study.

Have a medicine-chest of 12 tissue remedies or some allopathic medicines or homoeopathic
medicines. Serve the poor and sick with Atma Bhava. Give one-tenth of your income in charity.
This is the highest Yoga.

Do not make any difference between menial and respectable work. If any one is suffering
from acute-pain in any part of the body, at once shampoo the affected part very gently. Feel that you
are serving the Lord in the body of the patient. Repeat your Ishtamantra also. If you see a man or
animal bleeding on the roadside, never hesitate to tear your upper cloth or shirt and use it for
bandaging, in the absence of any other means of bandage. Do not bargain with the poor porters at
the railway station. Be liberal and generous. Keep always some small coins in your pocket and
distribute them to the poor and the decrepit.

YOGA

HATHA YOGA

Karma Yoga prepares the mind for the reception of light and knowledge. It expands the
heart and breaks all barriers that stand in the way of oneness or unity. Karma Yoga is an effective
Sadhana for Chitta Suddhi or purity of heart. Therefore, do selfless service constantly.

Hatha Yoga relates to the restraint of breath (Pranayama), Asanas, Bandhas and Mudras.
(cid:145)Ha(cid:146) and (cid:145)tha(cid:146) mean the union of the sun and the moon, union of Prana and Apana Vayus. (cid:145)Hatha(cid:146)
means any tenacious practice till the object or end is achieved. Trataka, standing on one leg, (a kind
of Tapas) and similar poses are all Hatha Yoga practices. Hatha Yoga is inseparable from Raja
Yoga. Raja Yoga begins where Hatha Yoga ends. Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga are interdependent.
Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga are the necessary counterparts of each other. No one can become a
perfect Yogi without a knowledge and practice of both the Yogas. Hatha Yoga prepares the student
to take up Raja Yoga.

A Hatha Yogi starts his Sadhana with body and Prana; a Raja Yogi starts his Sadhana with

his mind; a Jnana Yogi starts his Sadhana with Buddhi or intellect and will.

A Hatha Yogi gets Siddhis (psychic powers) by uniting Prana and Apana and by taking the
united Prana-Apana through the six Chakras (centres of spiritual energy) to Sahasrara at the crown
of the head. A Raja Yogi gets Siddhis by Samyama, i.e., combined practice of Dharana, Dhyana and
Samadhi at one time. A Jnana Yogi exhibits Siddhis through pure will or Sat-Sankalpa. A Bhakta
gets Siddhis through self-surrender and the consequent descent of grace. Kriyas, viz., Neti, Dhauti,
Nauli, Basti, Tratak and Kapalabhati belong to Hatha Yoga. All need not practise these Kriyas.
Those who have got much phlegm in the body should practise these Kriyas. Learn these under an
expert Hatha Yogi. Hatha Yoga is not the goal. It is only a means to an end. Take to Raja Yoga after
possessing good health.

Do Asana, Kumbhaka, Mudra and shake the Kundalini. Then take it to Sahasrara through
Chakras in the Sushumna. O children of light! Will you drink not, will you drink not, the nectar of
immortality?

Brother! Attain good health. Without health how can you live? Without health, how can you
earn? Without health how can you get success in Yoga or any undertaking? Possess wonderful
health through the practice of Hatha Yoga. Drink the nectar in Sahasrara and live in the immortal
abode of Siva.

YOGA ASANAS

Health is wealth. Health is indeed a covetable possession. Good health is a valuable asset to

one and all. It can be achieved by the regular practice of Yoga Asanas.

The practice of Asanas controls the emotions, produces mental peace, distributes Prana
evenly throughout the body and different systems, helps in maintaining healthy functioning of the

3

ESSENCE OF YOGA

internal organs, gives internal massage to the various abdominal organs. Physical exercises draw
the Prana (energy) out but the Asanas send the Prana in. The practice of Asanas cures many diseases
and awakens Kundalini Sakti. These are the chief advantages in the Yogic system of exercises
which no other systems have.

Practise a few Asanas daily at least for a period of fifteen minutes. You will possess
wonderful health. Be regular in your practice. Regularity is of paramount importance. Practise
Bhujang, Salabh, Dhanur, Sarvang, Hala and Paschimottasan Asanas. Bhujang, Salabh and Dhanur
will remove constipation and muscular pain of the back. Sirsh, Sarvang and Hala will help you in
maintaining Brahmacharya, rendering the spine elastic and curing all diseases. Paschimottasan will
reduce fat in the belly and help digestion. Relax all muscles in Savasana in the end.

Asanas should be done on empty stomach in the morning or at least three hours after food.
Morning time is best for doing Asanas. Do not wear spectacles when you do Asanas. Wear a singlet
if necessary and a Langotee. Be moderate in your diet. Practice of Brahmacharya is very important
for success in Yoga Asanas. Start with minimum time for each Asana and then gradually increase
the period. Answer the calls of nature before you start the practice. Boys and girls over ten years of
age as well as women can practise Asanas.

The world needs good, healthy, strong boys and girls. What do we find in these days in
India? India, the land of Rishis and sages, the land which produced Bhishma, Bhima, Arjuna,
Drona, Asvatthama, Kripa, Parasurama and countless other chivalrous warriors, the soil which
contained numberless Rajput chiefs of undaunted courage and matchless strength, now abounds in
weak and timid persons. Children beget children. The laws of health are ignored and neglected. The
nation is suffering and dying. The world requires numberless brave, moral, Adhyatmic soldiers
who are equipped with the five virtues, viz., Ahimsa, Satyam, Asteya, Brahmacharya and
Aparigraha.

PRANAYAMA

Pranayama is an exact science. It is the fourth Anga or limb of Ashtanga Yoga. It is the

regulation of breath or control of Prana.

Pranayama steadies the mind, augments the gastric fire, energises digestion, invigorates the
nerves, destroys the Rajas, destroys all diseases, removes all laziness, makes the body light and
healthy and awakens Kundalini.

Pranayama should be practised when the stomach is empty. Be regular in your practice. Do
not take bath immediately after the practice. Do not practise Kumbhaka or retention of breath in the
beginning. Have only slow and mild Puraka (inhalation) and Rechaka (exhalation). Do not strain
the breath beyond your capacity. Keep the ratio for Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka as 1:4:2.
Exhale very very slowly.

Sit on Padma, Siddha or Sukha Asana. Keep the head, neck and trunk in a straight line.
Inhale slowly through the left nostril and retain the breath according to the ratio, then exhale slowly

4

YOGA

through the right nostril. This is half process of Pranayama. Then inhale through the right nostril,
retain and exhale through the left nostril. Do not retain the breath for more than one or two minutes.

Do ten or twenty Pranayamas according to your capacity. Do not fatigue yourself. Increase
the number gradually. You can go up to 16:64:32. This is Sukhapurvaka or easy comfortable
Pranayama.

Practise Sitali in summer. This will purify your blood and cool the system too. Practise
Bhastrika in winter. This will cure asthma and consumption. Repeat (cid:145)Om(cid:146) or (cid:145)Rama(cid:146) mentally
during the practice. Observe Brahmacharya and diet-control. You will derive maximum benefits
and will quickly purify the Nadis or nerves.

Prana and mind are intimately related to each other. If you control Prana, the mind will also
be controlled. If you control the mind, the Prana will be automatically controlled. Prana is related to
mind, and through it to will and through will to the individual soul and through individual soul to
the Supreme Soul.

Start the practice this very second in right earnest. Control the breath and calm the mind.
Steady the breath and enter Samadhi. Restrain the breath and lengthen the life. Subdue the breath
and become a Yogi, a dynamo of power, peace, bliss and happiness.

KUNDALINI YOGA

Kundalini Sakti is the coiled-up, dormant, cosmic power that underlies all organic as well as
inorganic matter. It is the primordial energy that lies at the basal Muladhara Chakra in a dormant,
potential state. Kundalini Yoga is that Yoga which treats of Kundalini Sakti, the seven Chakras or
centres of spiritual energy, the arousing of the sleeping Kundalini Sakti and its union with Lord Siva
in Sahasrara Chakra at the crown of the head. The seven Chakras are pierced by the passing of
Kundalini Sakti to the top of the head.

The seven Chakras are: Muladhara (at the anus), Svadhishthana (at the root of the organ of
generation), Manipura (at the navel), Anahata (in the heart), Visuddha (in the neck), Ajna (in the
space between the two eyebrows) and Sahasrara (at the crown of the head).

Nadis are the astral tubes that carry Pranic currents. They cannot be seen by naked eyes.
They are not the ordinary nerves, arteries and veins. There are 72,000 Nadis. Among them three are
important. They are Ida, Pingala and Sushumna. Sushumna is the most important one, because
Kundalini passes through this Nadi only. The first step in Kundalini Yoga is the purification of
Nadis. When Sushumna is pure then only Kundalini will pass through it. Purification of Nadis is
done by the practice of Pranayama.

The Yogi opens the mouth of Sushumna Nadi through Pranayama, Bandhas and Mudras
and awakens the sleeping Kundalini and takes Her to Sahasrara at the crown of the head through the
lower six Chakras. Kundalini sleeps in the Muladhara in 3‰ coils. The three coils represent the
three Gunas and half coil represents the Vikritis.

5

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Kundalini is awakened through Pranayama, Asanas and Mudras by Hatha Yogins, through
concentration by Raja Yogins, through devotion and perfect self-surrender by Bhaktas or devotees;
through analytical will, by the Jnanis; by Japa of Mantra and by the grace of the Guru.

If you are pure and free from all desires, Kundalini will awaken by itself and you will be
benefited. If you awaken Kundalini by violent methods, forcibly, when your heart is impure, when
desires lurk in your mind, you will come across temptations of various sorts, when you move from
plane to plane, you will have a downfall. You will have no strength of will to resist these
temptations.

That aspirant who has firm faith in Yogic Sastras, who is courageous, devotional, humble,
generous, merciful, pure and dispassionate, can easily awaken Kundalini and attain success in
Samadhi. He should also be equipped with right conduct and self-restraint; he should constantly
engage himself in the service of his Guru and be free from lust, anger, Moha, greed and vanity.

When Kundalini is taken to the Sahasrara, when She is united with Lord Siva, perfect

Samadhi (super-conscious blissful state) ensues. The Yogi drinks the nectar of immortality.

May Mother Kundalini guide you all in your Yogic practices ! May Her blessings be upon

you all!

RAJA YOGA

Raja Yoga is an exact science. It aims at controlling all thought-waves or mental
modifications. It concerns with the mind, its purification and control. Hence it is called Raja Yoga,
i.e., king of all Yogas. It is otherwise known as Ashtanga Yoga i.e., Yoga with eight limbs.

The eight

limbs of Ashtanga Yoga are: Yama (self-restraint), Niyama (religious
observances), Asana (posture), Pranayama (restraint of breath), Pratyahara (abstraction of senses),
Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation) and Samadhi (super-conscious state). Yama is
practice of Ahimsa (non-injury), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya
(celibacy) and Aparigraha (non-covetousness) in thought, word and deed. This is the foundation of
Yoga. Niyama is observance of the five canons viz., Saucha (internal and external purity), Santosha
(contentment), Tapas (austerity). Svadhyaya (study of religious books and repetition of Mantras)
and Ishvara-Pranidhana (worship of God and self-surrender). Cultivate Maitri (friendship with
equals), Karuna (mercy towards inferiors), Mudita (complaisancy towards superiors), Upeksha
(indifference towards wicked people). You can eradicate jealousy and hatred and attain peace of
mind. Ascend the ladder of Yoga patiently through its different rungs and attain the highest summit
of the ladder, i.e., Asamprajnata Samadhi, wherein all Samskaras (impressions) which bring about
successive births are absolutely fried up.

If you really aspire to unfold the lurking divinity within, if you really want to get rid of the
meshes of this Samsara, you must know the technique of thought-control which is embodied in the
system of Raja Yoga. You must know the ways of right living, right thinking, right speaking and
right acting. You must practise the five rules of Yama or right conduct or Sadachara. You must
know how to withdraw the mind from external objects and fix it on one point. You must know the

6

YOGA

right method of concentration and meditation. Then alone you can be really happy. Then and then
alone, you will have power, independence and suzerainty. Then and then alone, you will attain
immortality, freedom and perfection. A knowledge of the ways and habits of the mind, its
operations, the laws of the mind and the methods of mind-control and mental discipline is very
necessary if you want to enjoy real happiness and peace of an unruffled and abiding nature.

Practise Raja Yoga, control the thoughts, discipline the mind, meditate regularly and attain

independence, immortality, freedom and perfection.

CONTROL OF MIND

Mind is Atma Sakti. It is through mind only that Brahman or the Supreme Self manifests as

the differentiated universe with heterogeneous objects.

Mind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras or impressions. It is nothing but a bundle of
habits. The true nature of the mind consists in the Vasanas or subtle desires. The idea of (cid:145)I(cid:146) or
egoism is the seed of the tree of mind. The sprout which springs up from this seed egoism is Buddhi
or intellect. From this sprout the ramifying branches called Sankalpas take their origin.

Mind is made up of subtle Sattvic matter. According to Chhandogya Upanishad, mind is

formed out of the subtlest portion of food.

Mind is of two kinds, viz., the Asuddha or impure mind and the Suddha or pure mind. The

former leads to bondage while the latter helps the aspirant to attain liberation.

Manolaya or temporary absorption of the mind in the object of meditation will not help you
to attain liberation. Manonasa or annihilation of the mind only will enable you to achieve the final
emancipation or Moksha.

Have no longing for objects. Reduce your wants. Cultivate Vairagya or dispassion.

Vairagya thins out the mind.

much.

Do not mix much. Do not talk much. Do not walk much. Do not eat much. Do not sleep

Control your emotion. Abandon desires and Vasanas. Control irritability and lust. Slay the
impure mind through the pure mind and transcend the pure mind through meditation. Practise
perfect Brahmacharya. There is no half measure in the spiritual path.

Never wrestle with the mind. Do not use any violent effort in concentration. When the mind
is jumping and wandering much, make no violent effort to control it but rather allow it to run along
for a while and exhaust its efforts. It will take advantage of the opportunity and will jump around
like an unchained monkey at first. Then it will gradually become quiet and look to you for orders.

If evil thoughts enter your mind, do not use your will-force in driving them. You will lose
energy. You will tax your will. You will fatigue yourself. The greater the efforts you make, the

7

ESSENCE OF YOGA

more the evil thoughts will return with redoubled force. They will return more quickly also. The
thoughts will become more powerful. Be indifferent. Keep quiet. Become a silent witness of those
thoughts. Do not identify yourself with them. They will vanish soon. Substitute good thoughts. Pray
and sing the Lord(cid:146)s name.

Never miss for a day your meditation. Regularity is of paramount importance. When the
mind is tired do not concentrate. Give a little rest. Do not take heavy food at night. This will
interfere with your morning meditation.

Japa, Kirtan, Pranayama, Satsanga (association with the sages), practice of Sama (serenity),
Dama (self-restraint), Yama (right conduct), Sattvic or pure food, study of scriptures, meditation,
Vichara or Atmic enquiry(cid:151)all these will help you to control the mind and attain eternal bliss and
immortality.

NADA YOGA

Sit in Padmasana or Siddhasana or Sukhasana. Close the ears with the thumbs. This is
Shanmukhi Mudra or Vaishnavi Mudra. Hear the music of Anahata sounds. You will have
wonderful concentration.

Do Japa (Ajapa Japa) of Soham with breath or Japa of any Mantra. Practise Pranayama for
one or two months. You will hear the ten sounds clearly and enjoy the music of the soul. The sound
that you hear will make you deaf to all external sounds.

Abandon all worldly thoughts. Control your passion. Become indifferent to all objects.
Practise Yama (self-restraint), or Sadachara (right conduct). Concentrate your attention on the
sound which annihilates the mind.

The sound serves the purpose of a sharp goad to control the elephant-mind which roams in
the pleasure garden of sensual objects. It serves the purpose of a snare for binding the deer(cid:151)Chitta.
Just as the bee which drinks the honey does not care for the odour, so the mind which is absorbed in
sound does not long for sensual objects.

The first sound is Chini, the second is Chinichini. The third is the sound of a bell. The fourth
is like that of a conch. The fifth is like that of a lute. The sixth is like that of a cymbal. The seventh is
like that of a flute. The eighth is like that of a drum. The ninth is like that of a Mridanga. The tenth is
like that of thunder. Hear the internal sound through the right ear. Change your concentration from
the gross sound to the subtle. The mind will soon be absorbed in the sound.

You will get knowledge of hidden things in the seventh. In the eighth stage you will hear

Paravak. In the ninth you will develop divine eye. In the tenth you will attain Para Brahman.

The sound entraps the mind. The mind becomes one with the sound as milk with water. It

becomes absorbed in Brahman or the Absolute. You will then attain the seat of Eternal Bliss.

KARMA YOGA

Chapter II

KARMA YOGA

KARMA YOGA

Haft-hearted service is no service at all. Give your whole heart, mind and soul when you

serve. This is very important when you practise Karma Yoga.

Some people have their body in one place, mind in another place, and soul in another place.

That is the reason why they do not realise any substantial progress in the path.

Forget not the goal of life amidst selfish activities. The goal of life is Self-realisation. Are
you attempting to reach the end and aim of life? Are you doing Japa, Pranayama and Meditation?
Have you kept up the ideal before the mind(cid:146)s eye? That day in which you do not practise any
spiritual Sadhana is wasted. Give the mind to God and the hands to work. You will have to analyse
and scrutinise your motives. It is the selfish motive and not the work itself that binds a man to
Samsara. Prepare the mind for Karma Yoga. Mere selfish work cannot be taken as Yogic activity.
The mind is so framed that it always expects something for a small piece of work. When you smile
you expect a return of smile from your friend. When you raise your hand in salutation, you will
expect a salute from other people. Even when you give a cup of water to another man, you expect
him to be grateful to you. When such is the case, how can you perform Nishkama Karma Yoga?

Life is very precious. Live in the spirit of the Gita teaching and work without expectation of
fruits and egoism. Think you are Nimitta in the hands of Lord Narayana. If you work with this
mental attitude you will become a Yogi soon. Work never degrades a man. Unselfish work is Puja
of Narayana. Work is worship. All works are sacred. There is no menial work from the highest
view-point of the absolute, from the view-point of Karma Yoga. Even scavenging when done with
the right spirit and mental attitude is Yogic action. Even a scavenger can realise God in his own
station of life by service. The famous butcher-Sadhaka of the Mahahharata realised God in his
meat-shop (through serving his parents). You have got inside all materials for wisdom. There is a
vast magazine of power and knowledge within you. It wants kindling. Now wake up, O Saumya!

When you work disinterestedly without any agency and when you surrender the works and
fruits as Ishvararpana, all Karmas are transformed into Yogic Kriyas. Walking, eating, sleeping,
answering the calls of nature, talking, etc., become offering unto the Lord. Every bit of work is
Yoga for you. Think that Lord Siva is working through your hands, and is eating through your
mouth. Think that your hands are the hands of Lord Siva. In the beginning some of your actions may
be selfish and some may be unselfish. In the long run you can do all actions in an unselfish manner.
Scrutinise your motives always. This is the key-note for Nishkama Karma Yoga. Every act can be
spiritualised when the motive becomes pure. Work is meditation. Serve everyone with intense love,
without any idea of agency, without expectation of fruits or reward. If you adopt the path of Jnana,
feel you are a silent Sakshi and the Prakriti does everything.

It is selfishness that has deplorably contracted your heart. Selfishness is the bane of society.
Selfishness clouds understanding. Selfishness is petty-mindedness. Bhoga increases selfishness
and selfish Pravritti. It is the root-cause for human sufferings. Real spiritual progress starts in
selfless service. Serve the Sadhus, Sannyasins, Bhaktas and poor and sick persons with Bhava,
Prema and Bhakti. The Lord is seated in the hearts of all.

The spirit of service must deeply enter into your very bones, cells, tissues, nerves, etc. The
reward is invaluable. Practise and feel the cosmic expansion and infinite Ananda. Tall tales and idle
gossip will not do, my dear friends! Evince intense zeal and enthusiasm in work. Be fiery in the
spirit of service.

Have Nishtha with God and Cheshta with hands like the Bahurupi who has the Nishtha of a
male and the Cheshta of a female. You will be able to do two things at a time by practice. The
manual work will become automatic, mechanical or intuitive. You will have two minds. A portion
of the mind will be at work; three quarters of the mind will be in the service of the Lord, in
meditation, in Japa. Karma Yoga is generally combined with Bhakti Yoga. A Karma Yogin offers
to the Lord as an oblation whatever he does through the Karma-Indriyas. This is Ishvara
Pranidhana.

TRAINING OF KARMA YOGA

A raw untrained aspirant feels, (cid:147)My preceptor is treating me like a servant or a peon. He is
using me for petty jobs.(cid:148) He who has understood the right significance of Karma Yoga will take
every work as Yogic activity or worship of the Lord. There is no menial work in his vision. Every
work is Puja of Narayana. In the light of Karma Yoga all actions are sacred. That aspirant who
always takes immense delight in doing works which are considered by the worldly man as menial
services, and who always does willingly such acts only will become a dynamic Yogi. He will be
absolutely free from conceit and egoism. He will have no downfall. The canker of pride cannot
touch him.

Study the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhiji. He never made any difference between
menial service and dignified work. Scavenging and cleaning of the latrine was the highest Yoga for
him. This was the highest Puja for him. He himself did the cleaning of latrines. He annihilated the
illusory little (cid:145)I(cid:146) through service of various sorts. Many highly educated persons joined his Ashram
for learning Yoga under him. They thought that Gandhiji would teach them Yoga in some
mysterious manner in a private room and would give lessons on Pranayama, meditation, abstration,
awakening of Kundalini, etc. They were disappointed when they were asked to clean the latrine
first. They left the Ashram immediately. Gandhiji himself repaired his shoes. He himself used to
grind flour and take upon his shoulders the work of others also when they were unable to do their
allotted portion of work for the day in the Ashram. When an educated person, a new Ashramite, felt
shy to do the grinding work, Gandhiji himself would do his work in front of him and then the man
would do the work himself from the next day willingly.

In the West, cobblers and peasants have risen to a very great position in society. Every work
is a respectable work for them. A boy applies polish to the boots in the streets of London for a
penny, carries newspapers and journals in the afternoon for sale and works as an apprentice under a

10

KARMA YOGA

journalist during his leisure hours at night. He studies books, works hard, never wastes a minute and
in a few years becomes a journalist of great repute and international fame. In Punjab some graduates
have taken to hair-dressing work. They have understood the dignity of labour.

A real Yogi does not make any difference between menial and respectable work. It is only
an ignorant man who makes such a difference. Some aspirants are humble in the beginning of their
spiritual career. When they get some name and fame, some followers, admirers, devotees and
disciples, they become victims to pride.

They cannot do any service. They cannot carry anything on their heads or hands. That Yogi
who carries the trunk on his head without the slightest feeling in the railway platform amidst a
multitude of his admirers, disciples and devotees, without making any outward show of humility
must be adored. Sage Jada Bharata carried the palanquin of King Rahugana on his shoulders
without murmuring. Lord Krishna shampooed the legs of a Raja when his barber devotee was on
leave. Sri Rama carried a pot of water for the ablution of one of his devotees. Sri Krishna took the
form of a menial servant as Vithoo and paid the money to the Nawab on behalf of his devotee,
Dhamaji. If you really want to grow in the spiritual path you must do all sorts of service daily till the
end of life. Then only you are safe. Do not stop doing service when you have become a famous
Yogi. The spirit of service must enter every nerve, cell, tissue and bone of your body. It must be
ingrained in you. Then only you will become a real fullblown practical Vedantin.

Is there any greater Vedantin or Karma Yogi than Lord Buddha? He still lives in our hearts,
because the spirit of service was ingrained in him and he spent his whole life in serving others in a
variety of ways. A magnanimous soul, one without a second! You can also become a Buddha if you
apply yourself diligently to selfless service with the right mental attitude.

ATTAIN NIRLIPTA STATE

Lord Krishna says in His Gita: (cid:145)Tasmat Sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmara yudhya cha".
(cid:147)Therefore at all times think of Me and fight.(cid:148) Give the mind to God and the hand to work. The
typist works at the machine and talks with his friends. The player on the harmonium plays on the
organ and talks and jokes with his friends. The lady knits and talks with her comrades. The mind of
the girl who has a water-pot on her head is on the water-pot, though she is talking and joking with
her companions while she is walking on the road. A nurse while she is nursing the baby of another
lady has her mind rivetted on her own baby. A cowherd while he is looking after the cows of other
people has his mind fixed on his own cow. Even so, have your mind fixed at the lotus feet of the
Lord, while you are doing your household duties and office work. You will
realise
Self-consciousness quickly. Just as the water remains unaffected in the lotus leaf, just as the oil
floats upon the surface of the water without being affected in any way, so also you should remain in
the world amidst troubles, pleasures and difficulties.

Just as the tongue is not affected by taking ghee, so also you should remain unaffected even
amidst worldly activities and troubles. You must keep up the Nirlipta state. This is Jnana. This is
balance (Samata). You may fail to keep the balance and Nirlipta state in thousand and one times.
But in the long run you are bound to succeed if you persist in your practice and if you discipline the
mind properly. Every failure is a pillar for future success. Remember this point well.

11

ESSENCE OF YOGA

A Karma Yogin should not expect even return of love, appreciation, gratitude, and

admiration from the people whom he is serving.

Only he who has reduced his wants and controlled the Indriyas can do Karma Yoga. How

can a luxurious man with revolting Indriyas serve others?

He wants everything for himself and wants to exploit and domineer others.

Another qualification is that you must be balanced in success or failure, gain or loss, victory
or defeat. You must be free from Raga and Dvesha. (cid:147)An action which is ordained, done by one
undesirous of fruit, devoid of attachment, without love or hate, is called pure(cid:148). (Gita XVIII-23).

WHAT IS KARMA

Karma means work or action. According to Jaimini, rituals like Agnihotra, Yajnas, etc., are
termed Karmas. There is a hidden power in Karma termed Adrishta which brings in fruits of
Karmas for the individual. Karma is all for Jaimini. Karma is everything for a student of Mimamsa
school of thought. Jaimini is the founder of Purva Mimamsa. He was a student of Maharshi Vyasa,
the founder of Uttara Mimamsa or Vedanta. The Mimamsa school denies the existence of Ishvara
who awards the fruits of works.

According to the Gita, any action is Karma. Charity, sacrifice, Tapas are all Karmas. In a
philosophical sense, breathing, seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, smelling, walking, talking, etc., are
all Karmas. Thinking is the real Karma. Raga-Dvesha constitute the real Karma.

HOW TO FIND RIGHT OR WRONG ACTION

Have right thinking. Use your reason and commonsense. Follow the injunctions of the
Sastras. Consult the code of Manu or Yajnavalkya Smriti whenever you have doubts. You will be
able to find out whether you are doing right or wrong action. If you say, (cid:145)Sastras are countless. They
are like ocean. I can hardly understand the truths that are inculcated. I cannot fathom and gauge
their depths. There are contradictions. I am puzzled and bewildered.(cid:146) Then strictly follow the words
of a Guru on whom you have absolute faith and confidence. The third way is: Have fear in God.
Consult your conscience. The shrill, inner voice will guide you. As soon as you hear the voice, do
not delay even a moment. Start the action diligently without consulting anybody. Practise to hear
the inner voice in the morning at four. If there is fear, shame, doubt or pricking of conscience, know
that you are doing a wrong action. If there is joy, exhilaration or satisfaction, understand that you
are doing the right action.

INNER VOICE

When the diverse, confining sheaths of the Atma have been dissolved by Sadhana, when the
different Vrittis of the mind have been controlled by mental drill or gymnastic, when the conscious
mind is not active, you enter the realm of spirit life, the super-conscious mind where Buddhi and
pure reason and intuition, the faculty of direct cognition of Truth, manifest. You pass into the
kingdom of peace where there is none to speak, you will hear the voice of God which is very clear

12

KARMA YOGA

and pure and has an upward tendency. Listen to the voice with attention and interest. It will guide
you. It is the voice of God.

PRAYER FOR A KARMA YOGIN

(By Sri Sankaracharya)

Atma tvam girija mitih sahacharah pranah sareeram griham.

Puja te vishyopabhogarachana nidra samadhisthitih,

Sancharah padoyoh pradakshinavidhih stotrani sarva giro;

Yadyat karma karomi tat tad akhilam sambhotavaradhanam.

Repeat the Sloka at the end of your meditation.

(cid:147)Thou art Atma: Buddhi is thy consort, Parvati (who is born of mountain); the Pranas are thy
attendants; this body is thy house; the action of sensual enjoyment is thy worship; deep sleep is the
establishment of Samadhi; walking by my feet is the perambulation around Thee; all my speeches
are thy praises; whatever actions I perform, are all Thy worship; Oh Sambho!(cid:148)

Chapter III

BHAKTI YOGA

BRAHMAN OR GOD EXISTS

Para Brahman cannot be demonstrated. But it is possible to infer the existence from certain
empirical factors. The existence of Brahman is known from the fact of its being the SELF of
everyone. For everyone is conscious of the existence of his self and never thinks (cid:147)I am not.(cid:148) If the
existence of his self were not known, everyone would think: (cid:147)I am not.(cid:148) This self, of whose
existence all are conscious, is Brahman. There is an inherent feeling in everybody: (cid:147)I exist(cid:151)Aham
Asmi.(cid:148)

You dream sometimes that you are dead and that your relatives are weeping. Even in that
supposed death state, you see and hear them weeping. This clearly indicates that, even after the
apparent death, life really persists. You exist even after the physical sheath is thrown out. That
existence is Atman or Brahman or the Supreme Self.

Close your eyes and imagine for a moment that you are dead. You can never do so. You can
never think that you will not exist after death. You will imagine that your dead body is lying flat and

13

ESSENCE OF YOGA

that you are witnessing the dead body. This definitely proves that you are always the witnessing
subject or Sakshi.

When you are in the dark, when you are behind a veil, if anybody enquires: (cid:145)Who is there?(cid:146),
you will unhesitatingly answer: (cid:145)It is I(cid:146). If he again asks you: (cid:145)Who is there?(cid:146) you will say: (cid:145)I am So
and So.(cid:146) This (cid:145)I am So and So(cid:146) is a mental Kalpnana or false superimposition on account of
ignorance. At first you have expressed spontaneously your inherent feeling of existence, the big
infinite (cid:145)I(cid:146). Nothing can resist this innate feeling of (cid:145)Aham Asmi.(cid:146)

By whose command are the earth and the sky, the sun and the moon, upheld in their places?
By whose command do the seas not overstep their limits? By whose command does the sun rise
punctually in the morning and set in the evening? By whose command do the seasons, solstices and
the years not transgress? By whose command do Karmas and their performers and their fruits not
likewise go beyond their appointed time? It is by the command of Brahman(cid:151)the Inner Ruler,
Controller and Governor.

What is common in trees, ants, birds, stones and man? Existence. A tree exists. A bird

exists. A stone exists. A man exists. Existence is Brahman.

Some are rich, some are poor. Some are healthy, some are born blind. Some die at eighty,
some die at ten. What is the cause for this variation? This clearly proves the theory of Karma that
there is one Omniscient Lord, who is the dispenser of fruits of actions of human beings, who fixes
the span of life in accordance with the nature of their actions, who knows the exact relation between
Karmas and their fruits. Karma is Jada or insentient. It certainly cannot dispense the fruits of the
actions.

In sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind and yet you experience the highest bliss.
Wherefrom have you derived the bliss? The mind rests in Brahman during sleep and it is from
Brahman that this Bliss is derived.

Cogito, ergo sum(cid:151)"I think, therefore, I am." This is Descartes(cid:146)s fundamental basis of
philosophy. Sri Sankara says: (cid:147)This Atman cannot be illusive, for, he who would deny it, witnesses
its reality even in denying it.(cid:148)

POWER OF PRAYER

Prayer elevates the mind. It fills the mind with purity. It is associated with praise of God. It
keeps the mind in tune with God. Prayer can reach a realm where reason dare not enter. Prayer can
move mountains. It can work miracles. It frees the devotee from the fear of death, brings him nearer
to God and makes him feel the divine presence everywhere. It awakens in him the divine
consciousness and makes him feel his essential immortal and blissful nature.

It was the prayer of Prahlada that rendered cool the burning oil when it was poured on his
head. It was the prayer of Mira that converted the bed of nails into a bed of roses and the cobra into a
flower-garland.

14

BHAKTI YOGA

Prayer has tremendous influence. Mahatma Gandhi was a great votary of prayer. If the
prayer is sincere and if it proceeds from the bottom of your heart (Antarika), it will at once melt the
heart of the Lord. Sri Krishna had to run bare-footed from Dvaraka on hearing the heart-felt prayer
of Draupadi. You all know this. Lord Hari, the mighty ruler of this universe, apologised before
Prahlada for coming a little late when the latter prayed. How merciful and loving is the Lord!

Say even once from the bottom of your heart: (cid:147)O Lord, I am thine. Thy will be done. Have
mercy on me. I am Thy servant and devotee. Forgive. Guide. Protect. Enlighten. Trahi.
Prachodayat.(cid:148) Have a meek, receptive attitude of mind. Have Bhava in your heart. The prayer is at
once heard and responded to. Do this in the daily battle of life and realise yourself the high efficacy
of prayer. You must have strong Astikya-Buddhi (strong conviction in the existence of God).

Christians have different prayers for getting various gifts and bounties from God.
Mohammedans and all religionists have daily prayers at sunrise, noon, sunset, just before retiring to
bed, just before taking food. Prayer is the beginning of Yoga. Prayer is the first important Anga
(limb) of Yoga. Preliminary spiritual Sadhana or practice is prayer.

God helps even a dacoit when he prays. Pray to God for purity, devotion, light and
knowledge. You will get these things. Get up early in the morning and repeat some prayers for
getting mental and physical Brahmacharya. Pray in any manner you like. Become as simple as a
child. Open freely the chambers of your heart. Sincere Bhaktas know pretty well about the high
efficacy of prayers. Narada Muni is still praying. Nama Deva prayed and Vittal came out of the
image to eat his food. Ekanath prayed. Lord Hari showed His Chaturbhuj form. Sri Krishna served
Damaji as a servant when he prayed; He played the part of a menial in paying his dues to the
Badshah. What more do you want? Pray fervently right now from this very second. Do not delay,
friend. That (cid:145)to-morrow(cid:146) will never come.

The power of prayer is indescribable. Its glory is ineffable. Only sincere devotees realise its
usefulness and splendour. It should be done with reverence, faith and Nishkama-Bhava
(non-expectation of fruits), and with a heart wet with devotion. O ignorant man! Do not argue about
the efficacy of prayer. You will be deluded. There is no arguing in spiritual matters. Intellect is a
finite and a frail instrument. Do not trust this. Remove now the darkness of your ignorance through
the light of prayer.

BHAKTI YOGA

The term (cid:145)Bhakti(cid:146) comes from the root (cid:145)Bhaj(cid:146) which means (cid:145)to be attached to God.(cid:146) Bhakti
is the form of supreme love towards God. It is love for love(cid:146)s sake. The devotee wants God and God
alone. There is no selfish expectation here. Bhakti is of the nature of nectar. It is the spontaneous
outpouring of love towards God. It is pure unselfish love or Suddha Prem. It is the sacred higher
emotion with sublime sentiments that unites the devotee with the Lord. It has to be experienced by
the devotees.

Bhakti is the basis of all religious life. Bhakti destroys Vasanas and egoism. Bhakti elevates
the mind to magnanimous heights. Bhakti is the master-key to open the chambers of wisdom.
Bhakti culminates in Jnana. Bhakti begins in two and ends in one. Para Bhakti and Jnana are one.

15

ESSENCE OF YOGA

There is no virtue higher than love; there is no treasure higher than love; there is no Dharma
higher than love; there is no religion higher than love; because, love is Truth and love is God. Love,
Prem and Bhakti are synonymous terms. This world has come out of love. This world exists in love
and this world ultimately dissolves in love. God is an embodiment of love. In every inch of His
creation, you can verily understand His love.

A life without love, faith and devotion is a dreary waste. It is a real death. Love is divine.
Love is the greatest power on earth. It is irresistible. It is love alone that can really conquer the heart
of a man. Love subdues an enemy. Love can tame wild ferocious animals. Its power is infinite. Its
depth is unfathomable. Its nature is ineffable. Its glory is indescribable. The essence of religion is
love. Therefore, develop pure love.

Do you really want God? Do you really thirst for His Darshan? Have you got real spiritual
hunger? Only he who thirsts for the Darshan of God will develop love. Unto him alone, He will
reveal Himself. God is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand for God, the
supply will come at once.

Develop the nine modes of Bhakti gradually. Hear the Lilas of the Lord: this is Sravana.
Sing His praise: this is Kirtana. Remember His Names: this is Smarana. Worship His lotus-feet: this
is Pada-seva. Offer flowers: this is Archana. Prostrate yourself before Him: this is Vandana. Do
service unto Him: this is Dasya-Bhava. Make friendship with Him: this is Sakhya-Bhava. Do total
unreserved self-surrender unto Him: this is Atma-Nivedana.

Sit not idly praying to God to help thee, but be up and doing as God helps only those who
help themselves. Do the best you can and leave the rest to God. Serve the devotees. Remain in their
company. Do Japa and Kirtan. Study Ramayana and Bhagavata. Live in Brindavan or Ayodhya for
some time. You will soon develop devotion.

Pray fervently like Prahlada. Sing like Radha. Repeat His names as Valmiki, Tukaram and
Tulsidas did. Do Kirtan like Gauranga. Weep in solitude like Mira for the separation from the Lord.
You will have Darshan of the Lord this very second.

Kindle the light of love in your heart. Love all. Include all creatures in the warm embrace of
your love. Cultivate Visva Prem or all-embracing, all-inclusive cosmic love. Love is a mysterious
divine glue that unites the hearts of all. It is a divine magical healing balm of very high potency.
Charge every action with pure love. Kill cunningness, greed, crookedness and selfishness.
Immortality can be attained only by performing acts of kindness continuously. Hatred, anger and
jealousy are removed by continuous service with loving heart. You will get more strength, more
joy, more satisfaction by doing kind acts. Practice of compassion, charitable acts, kind services
purify and soften the heart, turn the heart-lotus upwards and prepare the aspirant for the reception of
divine light.

The Sastras are endless. There is much to be known. Time is short. Obstacles are many. That
which is essence should be grasped, just as the swan takes the essence of milk alone from a mixture
of water and milk. That essence is love or Bhakti. Drink this essence and attain the everlasting
abode of Peace and Immortality.

16

Live in love. Breathe in love. Sing in love. Eat in love. Drink in love. Walk in love. Talk in
love. Pray in love. Meditate in love. Think in love. Move in love. Write in love. Die in love. Taste
the honey of divine love and become an embodiment of love (Prema-Vigraha of Prema-Murti).

May the fire of devotion grow brighter in you all! May your heart be filled with devotion!
May you all live drowned in the ocean of love in an illumined state! May the blessings of
Bhagavatas be upon you all! Peace be with you all!

BHAKTI YOGA

JAPA YOGA

Japa is the repetition of any Mantra or name of the Lord. In this Iron Age, Japa is an easy
way for God-realisation. Tukaram, Prahlada, Valmiki, Dhruva and several others attained salvation
by Japa alone. Sri Krishna says in the Gita, (cid:147)Yajnanam Japa-Yajnosmi(cid:148). Among the Yajnas, I am
Japa Yajna (Yaga)".

There are three kinds of Japa, viz., verbal or loud Japa (Vaikhari), semi-verbal Japa or
humming (Upamsu), and mental Japa or silent repetition through mind (Mansic). Mental Japa is
more powerful. It gives a reward ten thousand times more than the loud Japa. When the mind
wanders aimlessly take to loud Japa.

Japa must become habitual. It must be done with Sattvic or divine Bhava or feeling, purity,
Prema and Sraddha. There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the names of God or
Mantra. Every name is filled with countless Saktis or potencies.

Practice of Japa removes the impurities of the mind, just as soap cleanses the cloth of its
impurities. Be regular in your Japa. Japa destroys the sins and brings the devotee face to face with
God.

The name of God chanted correctly or incorrectly, knowingly or unknowingly, carefully or
carelessly, with Bhava or without Bhava is sure to give the desired fruit. The Bhava will come by
itself after some time. Get up at 4 a.m. and do the Japa for two hours. You will get the maximum
benefits.

The glory of the name of God cannot be established through reasoning and intellect. It can
certainly be experienced or realised only through devotion, faith and constant repetition of the
Name. Have reverence and faith for the name of God. Do not argue. Devotees of Lord Hari can
repeat the Mantras (cid:145)Hari Om(cid:146) or (cid:145)Om Namo Narayanaya(cid:146). Devotees of Sri Ram can repeat (cid:145)Sri
Rama(cid:146), or (cid:145)Sitaram(cid:146), or (cid:145)Om Sri Ram, Jaya Ram, Jaya Jaya Ram.(cid:146) Devotees of Sri Krishna can
repeat (cid:145)Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.(cid:146) Devotees of Lord Siva can repeat (cid:145)Om Namah Sivaya.(cid:146)
Perform 200 Malas of Japa daily. Wear a Mala on your neck. Mala is a whip to goad the mind
towards God.

O man! Take refuge in the Name. Name and Nami are inseparable. In this Iron Age, Japa is
the easiest, quickest, safest and surest way to reach God and attain immortality and perennial joy.
Glory to the Lord! Glory to His Name!

ESSENCE OF YOGA

SANKIRTAN YOGA

Sankirtan is singing God(cid:146)s name with feeling (Bhava), love (Prema) and faith (Sraddha). In
Sankirtan people join together and sing God(cid:146)s name collectively in a common place. Sankirtan is
one of the nine modes of Bhakti. You can realise God through Kirtan alone. This is the easiest
method for attaining God-consciousness in Kali Yuga or the Iron Age (cid:147)Kalau Kesava-Kirtanat(cid:148).

When several people join together and practise Sankirtan, a huge spiritual current or
Mahasakti is generated. This purifies the heart of the aspirants and elevates them to the sublime
heights of divine ecstasy or Samadhi. The powerful vibrations are carried to distant places. They
bring elevation of mind, solace, strength to all people and work as a harbinger of peace, harmony
and concord. They annihilate hostile forces and quickly bring peace and bliss to the whole world.

Lord Hari says to Narada, (cid:147)Naham Vasami Vaikunthe Yoginam Hridaye na cha,
Mad-Bhakta Yatra Gayanti Tatra Tishthami Narada(cid:148), i.e., (cid:147)I dwell not in Vaikuntha nor in the
hearts of the Yogins, but I dwell where my devotees sing my name, O Narada.(cid:148)

Kirtan destroys sins, Vasanas and Samskaras, fills the heart with Prem and devotion and

brings the devotee face to face with God.

Akhanda Kirtan is very powerful. It purifies the heart. The Mahamantra: (cid:145)Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare(cid:151)Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare
Hare(cid:146) or (cid:145)Om Namah Sivaya(cid:146) should be sung continuously for 3 hours or 24 hours, three days or a
week, by forming batches. One will lead and others will follow. Do Akhanda Kirtan on Sundays or
holidays. Do Prabhat-Pheri Kirtan in the morning around the streets. Kirtan in the early morning
is more effective than at night.

At night, sit before the picture of the Lord along with your children, family-members and
servants. Do Kirtan for one or two hours. Be regular in the practice. You will derive immense peace
and strength.

Sing the Lord(cid:146)s Name from the bottom of your heart. Be wholly and solely devoted to Him.

Delay in God-realisation is extremely painful. Merge in Him. Live in Him. Be established in Him.

May peace and prosperity abide in you all!

KALISANTARANA UPANISHAD

At the end of Dvapara Yuga, Narada went to Brahma and said: (cid:147)O Lord! How can I cross
Kali or mundane existence easily?(cid:148) Brahma replied. (cid:147)Well asked. Hearken to that which all Vedas
keep secret and hidden, through which one may cross the Samsara or mundane existence. He
destroys the evil effects of Kali through the mere uttering of the word (cid:145)Lord Narayana,(cid:146) who is the
primeval Purusha!(cid:148)

18

BHAKTI YOGA

Narada asked Brahma: (cid:147)O venerable Lord! What is the name?(cid:148) Brahma replied: (cid:147)The
names are: Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare.

These sixteen names destroy the evil effects of Kali or sins. There is no better means than
this in all the Vedas. These sixteen names destroy the Avarana or veil of ignorance that has
enveloped the Jivas or the human beings. Then just as the sun shines fully after the clouds are
dispersed, so also, Para Brahman or Supreme Self alone shines after the veil is removed."

Narada asked. (cid:147)O Lord! What are the rules to be observed when one utters these names?(cid:148)
Brahma replied:" O Rishi Narada! There are no rules. Whoever repeats these names three and a half
crores or 35 millions in a pure or an impure state, is freed at once from all sins. He is at once released
from all bondages. He merges himself in the Lord and attains Eternal Bliss and Immortality".

The Jiva has sixteen Kalas, corresponding to which sixteen words or names are given in this
Mahamantra. This is very good for repetition during Akhanda Kirtan. If you repeat this Mantra
20,000 times per day you will finish three and a half crores within 5 years. You can sing this Mantra
and can do Japa also. You can write this Mantra in a notebook as Likhita Japa.

The names of God, chanted in any way correctly or incorrectly, knowingly or unknowingly,
carefully or carelessly, is sure to give the desired result. The glory of the Name of God cannot be
established through reasoning and intellect. It can certainly be experienced or realised through
devotion, faith and constant repetition of the name only. The power of name is ineffable. Its glory is
indescribable. The efficacy and inherent Sakti of the name of God is unfathomable.

May you attain God-consciousness by repetition of the names of God as described above.

May you have real taste for the names of the Lord!

RAJA YOGA

Mind is a mysterious something which is really nothing but does everything.

It is born of Maya. It is a product of ignorance. It is a compound of Vasana and Sankalpa. It

is a mixture of worry and fear. It is a solution of Ahamkara. It is a confection.

Absolute and relative Manifestations.

Relative manifestations

Matter, Prana and Mind are the three relative manifestations of the Absolute. Prana is really
a modification or manifestation of Mind. Prana is Kriya Sakti or faculty of actions. Matter emanates
from Prana. Prana proceeds from mind. Matter is below Prana. Prana is above matter but below
mind. Prana is positive to matter but negative to mind. Mind is positive to both Prana and matter but
negative to will. Will is the centre of the ego. Will is the General-in-chief which directs the mind
and Prana to all parts and in all directions. Intuition is above reason and is the channel of
communication between man and spirit. Development of the Will-power by autosuggestion is the
basic principle of Raja Yoga or Vedanta. Superconscious Mind is the realm or Spirit of Life.

METAPHYSICS OF THE INNER MAN

The Physical body, the astral body, Prana, intellect or Buddhi, the instinctive mind, the
spiritual mind and the spirit are the seven principles of man. Buddhi is pure reason. The seat of
Buddhi is just below the crown of the head in the pineal gland of the brain. Buddhi is manifested
only in those persons who have developed right intuitive discrimination or Viveka. The ordinary
reason of the worldly people is termed practical reason, which is dense and has limitations.

Prana is the vital force, life-energy or Jiva-Sakti. It is the eternal symbol of God or Brahman.
It is Hiranyagarbha or Golden Son of God. It is the link between the astral and physical bodies.

20

RAJA YOGA

Prana is divided into physical Prana and psychic Prana. Breathing is external manifestation of
physical Prana. All thoughts are due to the vibrations of psychic Prana in the Chitta.

The causal body or Karana Sarira is the support for the astral and physical bodies. Will is

Para Sakti. Get this Sakti(cid:151)you will get Sat or Existence.

Chitta is the subconscious mind. It has two layers. One layer for emotion and the other for
passive memory. The instinctive mind is the lower nature of human beings. It is the desire mind or
Kama Manas. The Spiritual mind is the higher Manas. The seat of the mind is the heart. The mind
connected to the Somachakra of the lowermost portion or undersurface of the brain is termed the
organ of understanding. By Manonasa or annihilation of the mind is meant the destruction or
dissolution of the lower nature, desire-mind. Sankhya Buddhi or Buddhi in the light of Sankhya
philosophy is will and intellect combined. Mind is microcosm. Mind is Maya. Mind occupies an
intermediate state between Prakriti and Purusha, matter and Spirit.

TAME THE SIX WILD BEASTS

You have a whole menagerie within, with the lion, the tiger, the serpent, the elephant, the
ape, and the peacock. Bring them to subjection. The beauty of the flesh is really due to the
life-giving principle Prana. The beauty is attributable to the light that emanates from Atman. The
nasty body with oozing discharges from nine gutters is composed of five elements, is Jada-Vastu
and Apavitra. Always entertain this idea. Have a clear-cut, well-defined image-picture like this.
You will conquer lust by such a mental drill. If you understand the doctrine of unity in variety, if
you know there is only one Matter, one Energy, one Mind-substance, one Life, one Existence, Sat,
one Reality, and if you entertain always such a thought, you can control Krodha. If you remember
that you are only an instrument in the hands of God, that God is everything, God does everything,
God is just, then you can get rid of Ahamkara. You can annihilate Dvesha by Pratipaksha Bhavana.
Look to the brighter side of persons. Ignore the dark aspect.

Emotion is a motive power like the steam of an engine. It helps you in your evolution. Had it
not been for the presence of emotion you would have passed into a state of passivity or inertia. It
gives a push for action or motion. It is a blessing. But you must not become a prey to emotions. You
must not allow the emotions to rule over you. You must not allow them to bubble out. You must
purify and calm the surging emotions. You must allow it to rise slowly and subside quietly from the
mind-ocean. You must keep the emotion under perfect control. Do not mistake physical sensations
for higher sublime emotions. Do not be carried away by emotions. There are certain people who
like to hear some new sensational events just to arouse their emotions. They live on emotions,
otherwise they feel quite dull. This is a great weakness. This must be eradicated if they like to have a
calm, quiet life.

All evil qualities proceed from anger. If you control anger, all evil qualities will vanish by

themselves.

Ahamkara, Sankalpa, Vasana, Prana have intimate connection with the mind. There cannot
be any mind without these four. Prana is the life of the mind. Ahamkara is the root of the mind.
Sankalpas are the branches of the tree mind. Vasana is the seed of mind. This deep-rooted tree of

21

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Samsara of dire Ajnana which ramifies in various directions with branches full of flowers, tendrils,
fruits, etc., has the mind as its root. If this root-mind is destroyed, the tree of Samsara, this tree of
birth and death will be destroyed. Cut this root-mind with the axe of Brahma-Jnana. Chop off the
branches(cid:151)the Sankalpas(cid:151)with the knife of Vichara-Viveka.

The ever-restless mind becomes quiescent when all desires vanish. Desire raises Sankalpas
(thoughts). Man performs actions for acquiring the desired objects. Thus he is caught up in the
wheel of Samsara. The wheel stops when the Vasanas perish.

Just as there are doors in a bungalow between the outer and inner rooms, so also there are
doors between the lower and higher minds. When the mind is purified by the practice of Karma
Yoga, Tapas, right conduct or the practice of Yama, Niyama, Japa, meditation, etc., the doors
between the lower and the higher mind are opened. Discrimination between the real and the unreal
dawns. The eye of intuition is opened. The practitioner gets inspiration, revelation and higher
Divine Knowledge.

It is extremely difficult to have a calm and pure mind. But you must have such a mind, if you
want to have progress in meditation, if you desire to do Nishkama Karma Yoga. Then only you will
have a perfect instrument, a well-controlled mind at your disposal. This is one of the most important
qualifications for the aspirant, you will have to struggle hard for a long time with patience and
perseverance. Nothing is impossible for a Sadhaka who has iron-will and strong determination.

Just as soap cleanses the physical body so also Japa of a Mantra, Dhyana, Kirtan and

practice of Yama cleanse the mind of its impurities.

CHITTA

The subconscious mind is termed (cid:147)Chitta(cid:148) in Vedanta. Much of your subconsciousness

consists of submerged experiences, memories-thrown into the background but recoverable.

When you show symptoms of losing your memory, as you grow old, the first symptom is
that you find it difficult to remember the names of persons. The reason is not far to seek. All the
names are arbitrary. They are like labels. There are no associations along with the names. The mind
generally remembers through associations, as the impressions become deep thereby. You can
remember in old age some passages that you have read in schools and colleges. But you find it
difficult to remember in the evening a passage you have read in the morning. The reason is that the
mind has lost its Dharana-Sakti (power of grasping ideas). The cells have been degenerated. Those
who overwork mentally, who do not observe the rules of Brahmacharya and who are afflicted with
much cares, worries and anxieties, lose their power of memory soon. Even in old age you can
remember old events as there are associations with events.

The mental processes are limited to the field of consciousness alone. The field of
subconscious mentation is of a much greater extent than that of conscious mentation. Messages
when ready, come out like a flash from the subconscious mind or Chitta of the Vedantins. Only ten
per cent of mental activities come into the field of the consciousness. At least ninety per cent or our
mental life is subconscious. We sit and try to solve a problem, and fail. We look around, try again

22

RAJA YOGA

and again but fail. Suddenly an idea dawns and leads to the solution of the problem. The
subconscious processes were at work.

Sometimes you go to sleep at night with the thought (cid:147)I must get up very early in the morning
to catch a train(cid:148). This message is taken up by the subconscious mind and it is this subconscious
mind that wakes you up unfailingly at the exact hour. Subconscious mind is your constant
companion and sincere friend. You repeatedly fail at night to get a solution for a problem in
Arithmetic or Geometry. In the morning when you wake up you get a clear answer. This answer
comes like a flash from the subconscious mind. Even in sleep it works incessantly without any rest.
It arranges, classifies, compares, sorts all facts and works out a proper satisfactory solution. This is
all due to subconscious mind.

With the help of the subconscious mind you can change your vicious nature by cultivating
healthy, virtuous qualities that are opposed to the undesirable ones. If you want to overcome fear
mentally deny that you have fear and concentrate your attention upon the opposite quality, the ideal
of courage. When this is developed fear vanishes by itself. The positive always overpowers the
negative. This is an infallible law of nature. This is Pratipaksha Bhavana of the Raja Yogins. You
can acquire a liking for distasteful tasks and duties by cultivating a desire and taste for them. You
can establish new habits, new ideals, new ideas and new tastes and new character in the
subconscious mind by changing the old ones.

The functions of Chitta are Smriti or Smarana, Dharana (retention) and Anusandhana
(inquiry or investigation). When you repeat a Mantra it is the Chitta that does the Smarana. It does a
lot of work. It turns out better work than the mind or Buddhi.

All actions, enjoyments and experiences leave their impressions in the subconscious mind
in the form of subtle impressions or residual potencies. The Samskaras are the root of causing again
Jati, life and experiences of pleasure and pain. Revival of Samskaras induces memory. The Yogi
dives deep inside and comes in direct contact with these Samskaras. He directly perceives them
through the inner Yogic Vision. By Samyama (concentration, meditation and Samadhi) on these
Samskaras, he acquires knowledge of previous lives. By doing Samyama on the Samskaras of
others, the Yogi gets the knowledge of their past lives also.

When you desire to remember a thing you will have to make a psychic exertion. You will
have to go up and down the depths of the different levels of the subconscious mind and then pick up
the right thing from a curious mixture of multifarious irrelevant matter. Just as the mail sorter in the
Railway Mail Service takes up the right letter by moving the hand up and down along the different
pigeon-holes, so also the sorter in the subconscious mind goes up and down along the pigeon-holes
in the subconscious mind and brings the right thing to the level of normal consciousness. The
subconscious mind can pick the right thing out from a heap of various matters.

A Samskara of an experience is formed or developed in the Chitta the very moment the
mind is experiencing something. There is no gap between the present experience and the formation
of a Samskara in the subconscious mind.

23

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Smriti of memory is the function of Chitta (subconscious mind). It is a separate faculty or
category in Vedanta. Sometimes it is Antarangata (comes under the mind). In Sankhya philosophy
it is included in Buddhi or Mahat Tattva. The Chitta of Patanjali Rishi(cid:146)s philosophy of Raja Yoga
(Yogas Chittavritti-Nirodhah) corresponds to the Antahkarana of Vedanta.

MIND AND ITS MYSTERIES

Just as a busy officer works alone in a room by closing all the doors, so also the busy mind

works alone in a dream by shutting out all the doors of the senses.

Mind is a power born of the soul. It is through mind that the Lord manifests Himself as the

differentiated universe with heterogeneous objects.

Mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. Of all thoughts the thought (cid:145)I(cid:146) is the root. Therefore,

mind is only the thought (cid:147)I(cid:148).

Mind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras or impressions. It is nothing but a bundle of
habits. It is nothing but a collection of desires arising from contact with different objects. It is also a
collection of feelings aroused by worldly botherations. It is a collection of ideas gathered from
different objects. Now these desires, ideas and feelings constantly change. Some of the old desires
are constantly departing from their storehouse of the mind, and new ones are replacing them.

In the waking state, the seat of the mind is the brain; in the dreaming state the seat of the

mind is the cerebellum; in the deep sleep state it rests in the heart.

Mind always attaches itself to something objective. It cannot stand by itself. It is only this

mind that asserts itself as (cid:145)I(cid:146) in this body.

The things that we perceive all round us are only mind in form of substance.

Manomatram-Jagat Manah-Kalpitam Jagat. Mind creates. Mind destroys.

The occult phenomena that take place in the mental world are all based on scientific laws.
Occultists and Raja Yogins should have a comprehensive intelligent understanding of these laws.
Then only will they be able to control the psychic forces easily.

Practice of telepathy, thought-reading, hypnotism, mesmerism, distant healing, psychic
healing, etc., clearly proves that mind exists and that a higher developed mind can influence and
subjugate the lower minds. From the automatic writing and the experiences of a hypnotised person,
we can clearly infer the existence of subconscious mind which operates throughout the twenty-four
hours.

If an idea is planted in the mind, it grows at night through the operation of the subconscious
mind. The subconscious mind never takes any rest. It works vigorously throughout the twenty-four
hours. Those who know how to manipulate this subconscious mind can turn out tremendous mental
work. All geniuses have control over their subconscious mind. You must understand the ways of

24

RAJA YOGA

extracting work from the subconscious mind. Subconscious mind is a wonderful underground
mental factory.

Mind is the greatest force on this earth. He who has controlled his mind is full of powers. He
can bring all minds under his influence. All diseases can be cured by psychic healing. One is struck
with awe and wonder at the marvellous and mysterious powers of the mind of a man. The source or
home or support of this mysterious mind is God or Atman.

Any action that is done by the physical body is the outcome of a preconceived idea. The
mind thinks, plans and schemes at first. Then the action manifests itself. He who invented a watch at
first had all ideas in his mind about the construction of the lever, various wheels, dial, minute-hand,
second-hand, hour-hand, etc. These ideas materialised later on into actuality.

A spark of light presents the appearance of a continuous circle of light if it is made to rotate
quickly. Even so, though the mind can attend but to one thing at a time, either hearing or smelling,
though it can admit of but one kind of sensation at a time, we are led to believe that it does several
actions at a time, because it moves from one object to another with tremendous velocity, so rapidly
that its successive attention and preception appear as a simultaneous activity.

The best philosophers and seers (Rishis and sages) are unanimously agreed that the mind
cannot actually attend to more than one thing at a time, but it only appears to be doing so when it is
shifting with prodigious rapidity backward and forward from one end to the other.

Change of thought, relaxation of mind by dwelling on thoughts of pleasant objects,

cheerfulness, Sattvic food, mental recreation of Sattvic nature are necessary for mental health.

The mind assumes the shape of any object it intently thinks of. If it thinks of an orange it
assumes the shape of an orange. If it thinks of Lord Jesus on the Cross it assumes the shape of Lord
Jesus on the Cross. You must train the mind properly and give it proper pure food for assimilation.
Have a Divine background of thought or mental image.

If all the thoughts are eliminated, then there remains nothing which can be called mind. So
thoughts are the mind. Again there is no such thing as world, independent of and apart from
thoughts. Two thoughts, however, closely related to one another, cannot exist at the same time.

The mind becomes that on which it dwells. This is an immutable psychological law. If you
begin to think about the Dosha or defects of a man, for the time being at least your mind dwells on
the bad qualities and becomes charged with these qualities, whether the man possesses these bad
qualities or not. This may be your vain imagination only through your wrong thinking, wrong
Samskaras or wrong (bad) habits of the mind. He may not possess even a bit of the bad qualities
which you have superimposed on him through ill-will or some form of
jealousy or
petty-mindedness or habitual Dosha-Drishti or fault-finding nature. Therefore, give up the
dangerous habit of censuring others and finding fault in others. Praise others. Develop the power or
vision of finding only good in others. Do not bark like a wild dog about the bad qualities of others.
Glorify others. You will grow spiritually. You will be liked, honoured and respected by others.

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Deep sleep (Sushupti) is not merely a state of inactivity or passive repose. It has deep
philosophical significance. Vedantins study this state very deeply and carefully. It gives the clue for
non-dual philosophers to trace, search and find out the hidden, silent witness.

Atman is ever awake, although all the minds are at rest. Mother of this world, Rajesvari,
takes the Jivas back to Her and Her Lord during deep sleep, hugs them to Her bosom, bestows on
them refreshing peace, new vigour, vitality and strength and makes them quite fit for the ensuing
battle of life on the following day. But for this sleep, life would have been absolutely impossible in
this physical plane when miseries, diseases, cares, worries, fears and anxieties of various kinds
trouble men every second. If a man does not get sound sleep even for one night, if he loses his sleep
one night for three hours by keeping watch over a sick patient or attending the cinema, how
miserable, gloomy, depressed he feels the next day!

Mind is atomic according to the Indian school of logic. It is all-pervading according to Raja
Yoga school of Patanjali Maharshi; it is of the middling size (same size as that of the body)
according to the Vedantic school.

Mind is material. Mind is made up of subtle matter. This discrimination is made on the
principle that the soul is the only source of intelligence: it is self-evident; it shines by its own light.
Mind is formed out of the subtlest portion of the food.

Mind can be compared to water. Water exists in four states, viz., causal state, in the form of
hydrogen and oxygen;subtle state, in theform of water; gross state, in the form of ice: and gaseous
state,in the form of vaporised steam. Even so the mind is in a gross state during Jagrat state when it
enjoys sensual objects, is in a subtle state when it functions in the dream state, is in a causal state
when it gets involved into its cause, Mula-Avidya, during deep sleep and it evaporates as gas when
it melts or dissolves in Brahman during Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

Just as the physical body is composed of solid, liquid and gaseous matter, so also the mind is
made up of subtle matter of various grades of density with different rates of vibration. A Raja Yogi
penetrates through the different layers of the mind by intense practice.

Just as you nourish the physical body with food, so also will you have to give food for the

mind and spiritual food for the soul.

When your business fails, or when you are in heavy grief by the death of your only son, you
get emaciation of body even though you eat nourishing, substantial food. You feel tremendous
internal weakness. This clearly proves that mind exists and cheerfulness is a good mental food.

When a lady is deeply engaged in the management of the affairs of her daughter(cid:146)s marriage,
she forgets to take her food. She is always happy. Her heart is full of joy. The joy and cheerfulness
are powerful tonics for her mind. She gets inner mental strength although she does not take any
food.

26

RAJA YOGA

CONTROL OF MIND

Life in this physical plane is a mere preparation for the eternal life of everlasting sunshine
and joy which is to come when one gets knowledge of the Self through intense and constant
meditation after purifying the mind. This immortal life of supreme joy is described as the (cid:145)Kingdom
of Heaven(cid:146) in the Bible. That Kingdom of Heaven is within you, in your heart. Realise this
Immortal Life, O Susil! by controlling the mind, and enjoy the Supreme Bliss of the Self.

The secrets of Yoga Sastra can only be imparted to that student who is Jita-Indriya and
Abhyasa-sura, who has devotion to Guru, who has Vairagya, discrimination, who is firm in his
determination and who has strong conviction in the existence of God.

The mind is single, but it appears dual in dreaming state as the perceiver and the perceived,
through the power of Maya or illusion. The mind itself takes the forms of rose, mountain, elephant,
rivers, ocean, enemy, etc. Just as heat is inseparable from fire, so also fluctuation is inseparable
from mind. It makes the mind restless. The fluctuation is caused by the power of Rajas. It is the
fluctuation that causes Asanti (absence of peace of mind). The Bhaktas remove this tossing by Japa,
Upasana and worship of Ishtadevata.

The power of fluctuation is itself the mind. This fluctuating mind alone is this world. The
mind becomes no mind if fluctuation disappears. The mind ceases to exist, if it becomes destitute of
this fluctuation. What is called Maya is this fluctuating potency of the mind. Mind does havocs
through the power of fluctuation. Fluctuation is Mara or Satan or Vasana or Eshana or Trishna. It
was this fluctuation that tempted Visvamitra. It is this fluctuation that brings about the downfall of a
struggling aspirant. Destroy this fluctuation through strong Viveka, constant meditation and
ceaseless Brahma-Vichara.

As soon as fluctuation manifests itself various sorts of imaginations crop up. Imagination
co-exists with fluctuation. Imagination is as much dangerous as fluctuation. Fluctuation moves the
mind. Imagination fattens the mind. Mind minus fluctuation and imagination is a mere zero.
Fluctuation and imagination are the two wings of the mind-bird. Cut the right wing through Atmic
enquiry and the left wing through the practice of thoughtlessness. The great bird(cid:151)mind(cid:151)will fall
dead on the spot immediately.

The one dividing wall between the soul and body is mind. If this wall is broken by ceaseless
Atmic enquiry, then the Jiva mixes with the Supreme Soul just as the river mixes with the ocean.

Close your eyes. Meditate. Open your heart to the inflow of the invisible power. You will
find in the Bible (cid:147)Empty thyself, I will fill thee(cid:148). Then you will have abundant, superintuitional
knowledge which is beyond the reach of intellect. Just as water freely flows when the tap is turned
so also Divine Wisdom will flow freely when the obstacles of ignorance that stand in the way of
knowledge are removed. You will get flashes, glimpses of the Divine inspiration, revelation and
intuition. You will have to put yourself in a state of quietude by silencing all bubbling thoughts and
emotions and connect the mind with the source by withdrawing the mind from sensual objects, just
as you do in telephone by turning the switch off and connecting the two persons who want to speak.

27

ESSENCE OF YOGA

All duality is of mind. The whole of duality is caused by the imagination of the mind. If all
imaginations are withdrawn into the mind itself by constant practice of discrimination, Vairagya
(dispassion), Sama, Dama, and Samadhana, you will not experience the dual universe. The mind
will become no mind. As it has nothing to cognise, it will rest in the source, the Atman.

(cid:147)My mind was elsewhere, I did not see(cid:148). (cid:147)My mind was elsewhere, I did not hear(cid:148); for a

man sees with his mind and hears with his mind.

The attraction for objects and the ties of various sorts make the man bound to this world.
Renunciation of all attractions for objects and breaking up the ties constitute real Sannyasa. That
Sannyasi or Yogi who is free from attraction and ties enjoys the infinite bliss, supreme joy and
eternal bliss.

The mind should be absorbed in the word Om (Pranava). That Yogi or Jnani whose mind is

absorbed in Om has no fear whatever. He has reached the goal of life.

The fire of meditation rapidly consumes all evils and sins. Then there follows that

knowledge of Truth which confers perfections, everlasting peace and immortality.

Stop the Vrittis through constant and steady practice. The mind will become no mind. You
will attain Yogarudha State (the Absolute state). The seeds of Avidya in the form of potential
tendencies which are embedded in the mind are all burnt to ashes when the mind rests in the Truth
during Samadhi. The fire that burns is the fire of knowledge of Atman (Jnana-Agni, Yoga-Agni).

When the Yogi has attained the last stage of meditation, when he has entered into

Asamprajnata Samadhi, he becomes a Jivanmukta in this very life.

The fire of Yogic Samadhi burns all Samskaras in toto. There are now no seeds for rebirth.

SIDDHIS

A powerful occultist hypnotises the whole audience collectively through his power of
concentration and will, and performs the rope-trick. He throws a red rope in the air, gives the
suggestion to the onlookers that he will climb in the air through this rope and disappears from the
platform, in the twinkling of an eye. But, when a photograph is taken, nothing is recorded.

RAJA YOGA

move about to a distant place in the twinkling of an eye. Believe in the powers of the mind. If you
have interest, attention, will-power, faith you are bound to succeed. The source for the mind is
Atman or the Higher Self. This mind is born of Atman through His Maya or illusory power. Cosmic
mind is universal mind. Cosmic mind is the sum total of all individual minds. Cosmic mind is the
Hiranyagarbha or Ishvara or Karya-Brahman. Man(cid:146)s mind is just a fragment of the universal mind.
A Raja Yogi becomes one with the cosmic mind and knows the workings of all minds. The Yogi
gets omniscience through the cosmic mind. The Yogi experiences cosmic consciousness through
the cosmic mind.

Tap the universal mind. You will get higher supersensuous knowledge. You will experience
cosmic consciousness. You will get knowledge of the past, present and future. You will acquire
knowledge of the Tanmatras (root elements) and mental plane. You will experience clairvoyance
and clairaudience. You can know what is going on in the minds of others. You will get Divine
Aisvarya or Vibhutis of God. There are scientific means to tap this universal mind. Purity,
concentration, dispassion, right living, right thinking, right conduct, right action, devotion,
moderation in eating and sleeping, purity in food, truthfulness, continence, non-injury, austerities
have to be regularly practised for a protracted time.

Look at the marvels of mind! One is struck with awe and wonder when he witnesses a
hypnotised person in trance and hears his narratives. The hypnotised person narrates very lucidly
the life-history and incidents of a person whom he has not seen in his life.

A maid servant (a Jew) who was attending on a Hebrew Priest used to hear the Hebrew
verses during her service. She suddenly developed a double-personality when she was sick in the
hospital and repeated Hebrew verses. She did not know the Hebrew language. All the Samskaras
(of hearing from the priest) were in the subconscious mind, and she repeated the verses. No
Samskaras are lost. They are indelibly recorded in the gramophonic machine of Chitta.

A priest used to forget his old personality and assume a new personality, a new name, a new
avocation for six months. When he developed a double-personality he could leave his old house,
entirely forget all about his old life and would return to his native place after six months and would
entirely forget all about the second personality he assumed for six months.

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

TWENTY SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Get up at 4 a.m. daily. This is Brahma Muhurta which is extremely favourable for

meditation on God.

2. ASANA: Sit on Padma, Siddha or Sukha Asana for Japa and Meditation for half an hour,
facing the east or the north. Increase the period gradually to three hours. Do Sirshasana and
Sarvangasana for keeping up Brahmacharya and health. Take light physical exercises as walking,
etc., regularly. Do twenty Pranayamas.

3. JAPA: Repeat any Mantra as pure Om or Om Namo Narayanaya, Om Namah Sivaya, Om
Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Om Saravanabhavaya Namah, Sita Ram, Sri Ram, Hari Om, or
Gayatri, according to your taste or inclination, from 108 to 21,600 times daily.

4. DIETETIC DISCIPLINE: Take Sattvic food, Suddha Ahara. Give up chillies, tamarind,
garlic, onion, sour articles, oil, mustard and asafoetida. Observe moderation in diet (Mitahara). Do
not overload the stomach. Give up those things which the mind likes best for a fortnight in a year.
Eat simple food. Milk and fruits help concentration. Take food as medicine, to keep life going.
Eating for enjoyment is sin. Give up salt and sugar for a month. You must be able to live on rice,
dhall and bread without any chutni. Do not ask for extra salt for dhall and sugar for tea, coffee, or
milk.

5. Have a separate meditation-room under lock and key.

6. Do charity regularly, every month, or even daily, according to your means, say six paisa

per rupee.

7.

SVADHYAYA:

Study

8. Preserve the vital force (Veerya) very very carefully. Veerya is God in motion or
manifestation, Vibhuti. Veerya is all power. Veerya is money. Veerya is the essence of life, thought
and intelligence.

9. Get by heart some prayer, Slokas, Stotras, and repeat them as soon as you sit on the Asana

before starting Japa or meditation. This will elevate the mind quickly.

10. Have Satsanga. Give up bad company, smoking, meat and alcoholic liquors entirely. Do

not develop any evil habits.

13. Observe Mouna for a couple of hours daily.

14. Speak the truth at all cost. Speak a little. Speak sweetly.

15. Reduce your wants. If you have four shirts reduce the number to three or two. Lead a

happy contented life. Avoid unnecessary worry. Have plain living and high thinking.

16. Never hurt anybody. Control anger by love, Kshama (forgiveness) and Daya

(compassion).

17. Do not depend upon servants. Self-reliance is the highest of all virtues.

18. Think of the mistakes you have committed during the course of the day, just before
retiring to bed (self-analysis). Keep daily diary and self-correction register. Do not brood over past
mistakes.

19. Remember that death is awaiting you every moment. Never fail to fulfil your duties.

Have pure conduct (Sadachara).

completely to God (Saranagati).

20. Think of God as soon as you wake up and just before you go to sleep. Surrender yourself

This is the essence of all spiritual Sadhanas. This will lead you to Moksha. All these

Niyamas or spiritual canons must be rigidly observed. You must not give leniency to the mind.

RESOLVES

The spiritual path is thorny, precipitous and rugged. Temptations will assail you. Your will,
sometimes, will become weak. Sometimes, there will be downfall or a backward pull by the dark
Asuric antagonistic forces. In order to strengthen your will and resist the unfavourable currents, you
will have to make, again and again, fresh resolves. This will help you to ascend the ladder of Yoga,
vigorously and quickly. Here are some resolves. Stick to them tenaciously. Watch the mind
carefully and keep a daily spiritual record.

1. I must get up at 4 a.m. today for practising meditation. (I will have an alarm time-piece).

2. I will certainly observe Brahmacharya for a month.

3. I will, at any cost, speak the truth today.

4. I will not speak harsh or vulgar words today.

31

ESSENCE OF YOGA

5. I will do 21,600 (200 Mala) Japa this Sunday.

6. I will observe complete Mouna this Sunday.

7. I will live on milk and fruits this Ekadasi.

8. I will finish the study of the whole of Gita on this Sunday (Svadhyaya) and write my Ishta

Mantra or Guru Mantra for 2 hours.

9. I will spend one-tenth of my income on charity this month.

10. I will take only three things today(cid:151)dhall and bread in the noon and milk at night.

11.I will not use shoes and bed-stead today.

12.I will not become angry today.

I will give up night meals and do 10 Malas of Japa if I break any of my resolves.

When you make these resolves, stand before the Lord(cid:146)s picture with folded hands and pray
devoutly for His grace and mercy. You will doubtless get immense strength to carry out these
resolves.

Even if you fail in your attempt, do not be discouraged. Every failure is a stepping-stone for
success. Make a fresh resolve again with more firm and fiery determination. You are bound to
succeed. Conquest over one weakness will give you additional strength and will-force to get over
another weakness or defect. The baby tries to walk, gets up and falls down. Again it makes another
attempt. Eventually it walks steadily. Even so, you will have to fall down and get up, again and
again, when you walk in the spiritual path. In the long run, you will steadily climb up to the summit
of the hill of Yoga and reach the pinnacle of Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

May the Lord give you strength of will to carry out your resolves!

MESSAGES OF VAIRAGYA

There is not even an iota of bliss in this world. Every thing is illusory in this universe. All
worldly things are generative of pain only and fraught with all dangers. This life is ephemeral.
There is nothing so baneful as this life which is perishable in its nature. What beauty is there to be
enjoyed in this body which is composed of blood and flesh and which has a tendency to rot? Even
the most virulent poison is no poison but the sensual object is truly so. The former kills only one
body, whereas, the latter destroys many bodies in successive births.

Fie on this uneven life which is attended with pains, sorrows, diseases and death. You
cannot find one object in this universe which is sweet and beneficial for one twinkling of the eye at
least. Even the greatest of persons will, in course of time, become dust(cid:151)the lowest of the low.
Emperors, poets, scientists, orators and intellectual giants have come and gone.

32

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

It is very difficult to get a human birth. This precious life is meant for attaining
Self-realisation. Ignorant persons, like innocent children that do taste again and again sweetmeats
which give sweetness for the time being, indulge themselves in illusory, transient, sensual pleasures
and are caught, again and again, in the wheel of births and deaths. They are not ashamed to repeat
the same sensual act. What a miserable life they lead! How pitiable is their lot. !

You are elated when you get a son, when you get married, when you get some sudden
fortune or increase in salary; but you feel sorry when your wife dies, when you lose your money,
when you are thrown out of employment, when you suffer from some acute pain.

Now tell me, friend, what do you really find in this illusory world(cid:151)happiness or pain? Have
you now understood the illusory nature of this world? This world is a mere show. The mind and the
senses are deceiving you at every moment. You have mistaken pain for pleasure. There is not even
an iota of happiness in this universe.

Will your son, or daughter, or friend, or relative,help you when you are about to die? Have
you got one, sincere, unselfish friend in this world? All are selfish. There is no pure love. But that
Lord, your real immortal friend and father who dwells in your heart, will never forsake you though
you may forget Him. Adore Him in silence, that God of gods, that Divinity of divinities, Highest of
the most high. May He bless you with His love, wisdom, power and peace!

By indiscriminate clinging to wife, children, house, wealth and property, you have forgotten
all about your essential divine nature. In youth you are enveloped in ignorance; in adult age you are
entangled in the meshes of women; in old age you are groaning under the burden of Samsara. When
you will find time, friend, to do virtuous actions and worship God?

Sensual pleasure is momentary, deceptive, illusory and imaginary. A grain of pleasure is
mixed with a mountain of pain. Enjoyment cannot bring satisfaction of desires. On the contrary, it
makes the mind more restless through intense craving. Sensual pleasure is the cause of births and
deaths. It is an enemy of peace and knowledge.

Abandon these selfish struggles and schemes for amassing wealth. Do all actions with
Nishkama Bhava. March directly to that wire-puller (God), who is moving these toys of fleshy
human bodies, who is keeping up this big show, who is behind this pageant. In Him only you will
find everlasting happiness and perennial joy. Merge in Him by practising daily Japa and
Meditation.

Give up clinging to this illusory life. Take refuge in God. Develop lasting, sustained
dispassion (Vairagya) or indifference to sensual enjoyments herein and hereafter. You have had
countless fathers, mothers, wives and children in the past. You came alone. You will go alone. No
one will follow you save your own actions. Worship God. Realise Him. All miseries will come to an
end.

O Ram! Do you not wish to attain the illimitable kingdom of eternal bliss and perennial joy?
Do you not long to attain everlasting peace and immortality? Do you not desire to dwell in that

33

ESSENCE OF YOGA

sweet abode of Brahman where there is neither pain nor sorrow, neither hunger nor thirst, neither
fear nor grief, neither doubt nor delusion?

Then come, my beloved Ram! Develop, real, lasting Vairagya (dispassion or mental
non-attachment) by looking into the defects of sensual life (Dosha Drishti) and through association
with Sages, Sadhus and Sannyasins (Satsanga). Serve. Love. Give. Be kind. Be good. Do good.
Practise vigorous Japa and meditation and attain God-consciousness or Self-realisation (Brahma
jnana) in this very birth.

May you all possess that master-key, Vairagya to open the realms of Brahmic bliss!

May you all attain Kaivalya or Atma-Svarajya or independence! May you all dwell in the

immaculate Brahmic seat of ineffable splendour and glory!

LIVE WISELY

Minus skin, minus dress, minus ornaments, physical beauty is nothing. Just imagine for a
moment that the outer skin is removed. You will have to stand with a long stick to drive away crows
and vultures. Physical beauty is superficial, illusory and fading. It is skin-deep only. Do not be
deluded by external appearances. It is the jugglery of Maya. Go to the source(cid:151)Atman, the Beauty
of beauties, the Everlasting beauty.

If your hairs become grey, that is the first warrant from Lord Yama, the God of Death. You
must get yourself ready to meet him. The wrinkles on the face and the bending of the body will
remind you of the warrant. When the teeth fall and the eyesight becomes dim, you must be fully
prepared to greet him. You will get three hiccups or final passing of breaths lying on the bed. When
the last hiccup comes, all your possession will be taken away by your sons and partners. One will
run after the savings bank pass-book, another will take hold of the cash chest, the third, of your
provident fund papers and insurance claims, the fourth, of the ornaments that lie on your person and
so on. Such is life on this earth-plane. Why can(cid:146)t you see that the money is well spent for your
spiritual progress and the service of the poor and the Mahatmas? Friends! Try to attain immortality
through devotion, meditation, purity, service, Japa, prayer and enquiry. All troubles and miseries
will come to an end.

O Nectar(cid:146)s sons! Enough of this mundane life. Enough of this life of passion in this
earth-plane. You have spent your whole life, energy and time in obtaining material wealth, power,
name and fame. All your efforts have gone in vain. All your wealth is only a broken shell when
compared with the inexhaustible or supreme wealth of Atman. Obtain this spiritual wealth. Give up
this vain selfish struggle. You have walked too long with passionate eyes in this universe. Give up
this lustful look. Meditate. Look within now and behold the marvellous Self and be free.

Atman or Brahman or Supreme Self is the hidden treasure. It is the pearl of incalculable
value. It is the jewel of jewels. It is the gem of gems. It is the imperishable, inexhaustible, supreme
wealth which no dacoit can rob. It is Chintamani of Chintamanis that will give man whatever he
wishes.

34

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

Brahman is beyond speech, time and causation. It is limitless. It is tranquil and It shines with
equal effulgence in all bodies. It cannot be a particular thing. It is Chaitanya or pure consciousness.
It is Vastu. It is Sat-Chit-Ananda.

Knowing the nature of Brahman or Atman as such, attain freedom or perfection. Think
yourself bodiless. Identify yourself with the Supreme. Achieve peace and eternal bliss of your
all-pervading soul.

May you all lead the divine life sharing what you have with others, singing the Lord(cid:146)s name,

rejoicing in Him alone and melting the mind in the Supreme Self!

MESSAGE OF BRAHMACHARYA

Brahmacharya is purity in thought, word and deed. Brahmacharya includes the control of
not only the sex or reproductive Indriya but also other Indriyas. This is the definition of
Brahmacharya in a broad sense. Brahmacharya is of two kinds viz., physical and mental. Physical is
control of the body and mental is the control of evil thoughts. In mental Brahmacharya even a
lustful thought will never enter the mind. Freedom from all sexual thoughts in waking as well as
dreaming states is strict Brahmacharya.

The vital energy, the Veerya, which supports your life, is a great treasure for you. It is the
quintessence of blood. Brahmacharya is truly a precious jewel. It is the most effective medicine or
nectar which destroys diseases, decay and death. This Atma or immortal soul is verily the nature of
Brahmacharya. Atma resides in Brahmacharya.

Veerya is the essence of life, thought, intelligence and consciousness. When the Veerya is
once lost, it can never be recouped in your lifetime by your taking any amount of Badam, nervine
tonics, milk, cream, Makaradhvaja, etc. This fluid, when preserved carefully, serves as a
master-key for you to open the doors of elysian bliss or the realms of God or Atma and for all sorts
of higher achievements in life. By Brahmacharya alone the Rishis of yore have conquered death and
attained the immortal abode of joy and bliss.

You cannot have health and spiritual life without Brahmacharya. Brahmacharya is the
key-note of success in every walk of life. Brahmacharya serves as a gateway for bliss beyond. It
opens the door of Moksha (emancipation). Siddhis and Riddhis (psychic powers) roll under the feet
of a Brahmacharin. Who can describe the majesty and glory of a Brahmachari? Brahmacharya or
spotless chastity is the best of panaceas. There is nothing in this world that cannot be attained by a
celibate. He can move the whole world.

Sensuality destroys life, lustre, strength, vitality, memory, wealth, fame, holiness and
devotion to the Supreme. Death is hastened by letting out vital energy from the body. Life is saved
and prolonged by preserving it. Those who have lost much of their Veerya or the vital energy
become easily irritable and lazy. They easily succumb to any disease. They meet with premature
death.

35

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Have you realised, my dear friend, the importance and glory of Brahmacharya? Have you
recognised the true significance of Brahmacharya? How can you expect to be strong and healthy if
the precious energy that is acquired through various means with great difficulty is wasted daily?

What do we find in these days? Men, women, boys and girls are drowned in the ocean of
impure thoughts, lustful desires and little sensual pleasures. It is highly deplorable indeed. Many
college students have personally come to me and narrated their pitiable lives of gloom and
depression brought about by heavy loss of semen through unnatural means. Persons are physically,
mentally and morally debilitated because of the want of Brahmacharya or because of wasting the
seminal power. Such persons become easily irritable for little things. They fall a victim to various
diseases and premature death. I appeal to the parents, the teachers and the professors to instruct and
guide their children in Brahmacharya at the proper time and save them. Through them the country is
saved. Youths are the future hope of the country. If they are inspired the whole nation is inspired
and elevated.

It is quite possible for a man to practise celibacy albeit there are various sorts of temptations
and distractions. A well-disciplined life, study of Scriptures, Satsanga, Japa, Dhyana, Sattvic diet,
daily self-analysis, practice of sadachara, and the three kinds of Tapas and such other spiritual
discipline, pave a long way in the attainment of this end.

The practice of celibacy is not attended with any danger or any disease or any undesirable
result, such as the various sorts of (cid:145)complex(cid:146) which are wrongly attributed by the Western
psychologists to it. They have no practical knowledge of the subject on hand. They have got a
wrong ill-founded imagination that the ungratified sex-energy assumes various forms of complexes
in disguise, such as, touch-phobia, etc. It is a morbid state of mind due to excessive anger, hatred,
jealousy, worry and depression brought about by various causes.

Householders who are moderate in their sexual enjoyment, who are free from animal
passion, who are desirous of progeny to keep up the line only, are also Brahmacharins. This is also
Brahmacharya Vrata. As soon as a son or daughter is born, the wife becomes his mother.

Do not look at obscene pictures. Do not speak vulgar words. Do not read novels that excite
passion and produce ignoble, undesirable sentiments in the mind. Shun bad company. Do not go to
Cinemas. Give up onions, garlic, hot curries, chutnies and spiced dishes. Take wholesome, bland
Sattvic food. Transmute the sex-energy into spiritual energy (Ojas) by sublime thoughts, practice of
Japa, Kirtan (singing God(cid:146)s Name), Vichara or Atmic enquiry, Pranayama (restraint of breath),
Sirshasana, Sarvangasana, study of Gita, Upanishads and other
religious books. Have
Satsanga(cid:151)association with Mahatmas, Yogins and Sadhus. You will be established in
Brahmacharya. There will be sublimation of sex-energy.

Glory to Brahmacharya! Glory to Brahmacharins who are veritable gods on earth! May you
all attain immortality by leading a life of Brahmacharya or ideal divine life while remaining in the
world!!

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

UPADESAMRITAM

In the name of Tapascharya (austerities) do not spoil your health. Constant repetition of
(cid:147)Vairagya Dindima(cid:148) of Sri Sankara, with feeling, study of (cid:147)Vairagya Sataka(cid:148) of Bhartrihari and
(cid:147)Vairagya Prakarana(cid:148) of Yoga-Vasishtha, reflection on the Slokas of Gita which treat of Vairagya,
and finding out the defects in the sensual life will surely intensify your Vairagya.

Spiritual growth is gradual. There is progressive evolution. You should not be in a feverish
hurry to accomplish great Yogic feats or enter into Nirvikalpa Samadhi (superconscious state) in
two or three months. You will have to ascend the ladder of Yoga step by step. You will have to
march in the spiritual path stage by stage.

This world is your best teacher. You will have yet to learn many lessons from this world.
The worldly duties are not ties when done in the spirit of Nishkama Karma Yoga (selfless service).
You are not required to renounce the world and take shelter in the Himalayan caves to claim back
your lost divinity. The secret of renunciation is renunciation of egoism and desires. Live in the
world but be not worldly-minded. He who, living in the midst of the temptations of this world,
attains perfection, is a true hero indeed.

Guru(cid:146)s grace is needed by the disciple. This does not mean that the disciple should sit idle
and expect a miracle from the Guru to push him directly into Samadhi. The Guru cannot do Sadhana
or the spiritual practice for the student. He can guide the aspirant, clear his doubts, pave the way,
remove snares, pitfalls and obstacles and throw light on the path. The disciple himself will have to
place each footstep in the spiritual path. He will himself have to place his footstep in each rung of
the ladder of Yoga.

Know things in their proper light. Do not be deluded. Emotion is mistaken for devotion;
violent jumping in the air during Sankirtan for divine ecstasy; falling down in swoon on account of
exhaustion from too much jumping for Bhava Samadhi; Rajasic restlessness and motion for divine
activities and Karma Yoga; Tamasic man for Sattvic man; movement of air in the back due to
rheumatism for ascent of Kundalini; Tandri and deep sleep for Samadhi; Manorajya or building
castles in the air for meditation; physical nudity for the Jivanmukti state.

Understand the laws of the universe. Move tactfully in this world. Learn the secrets of
Nature. Try to know the best ways to control the mind. Conquer the mind. Conquest of mind is
really conquest of nature and the world. Conquest of mind will enable you to go to the source of
Brahman and you can realise: (cid:147)I am the all-pervading Sat-Chit-Ananda Atman or the Self(cid:148).

Learn to discriminate and become wise. Fight out the inner battle, again and again, and

come out victorious, O Sushil!

May you all become dynamic Yogins and radiate joy and peace to all corners of the world!

PRACTICAL SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

Thou art divine. Live up to it. Feel and realise thy divine nature. Do not murmur when you
get difficulties, troubles, tribulations and diseases. Every difficulty is an opportunity for you to
develop your will and power of endurance and to grow strong. Conquer the difficulties one by one.
This is the beginning of a new life, a life of expansion, glory and divine splendour. Aspire and draw.
Grow. Expand. Build up all positive qualities, the Daiva-Sampatti, viz., fortitude, patience and
courage, that are dormant in you. Tread the spiritual path and realise: (cid:145)I am the Immortal Self."

Never weep even if you lose your near and dear relations. Births and deaths are the two
illusory scenes in the marvellous drama of this world. They are all the jugglery of Maya. In reality
nobody comes and nobody goes. Atman alone exists. Atman is Brahman or the Immortal Soul.

Be hopeful always. Face all difficulties, tribulations and anxieties in life with a smile.
Always repeat the formula (cid:147)Even this will pass away.(cid:148) You will then be always beyond grief and
sorrow.

Pain is a blessing in disguise. Pain is an eye-opener. Pain is your silent teacher. Pain will
turn your mind towards God. Many old Karmas have to be purged out quickly by the thirsting
aspirant before he attains the blissful Samadhi (superconscious state). Therefore, the thirsting
aspirant only will get more troubles. Become a spiritual warrior and chop off the thoughts and
subtle forms of secret desires for enjoyment. A glorious brilliant future is awaiting you.

Conquer difficulties one by one. Stand adamant. Root yourself in the immortal
Sat-Chit-Ananda Atman or Self within. Develop a magnanimous, serene, calm and poised mental
state. Sing (cid:147)Anandoham, Anandoham(cid:151)I am all bliss. I am all bliss.(cid:148)

To live is to fight for the ideal and goal. Life is conquest. Life is a series of awakenings.
Conquer your mind and the senses. These are your real enemies. Live under lifelong vows. Conquer
your internal and external nature. Fight against the antagonistic dark evil forces through Japa and
meditation.

If you are firm in your resolves to reach the highest goal of Yoga, if you have firm
determination to attain the aim of spiritual life, you will rise up again and march forward even if you
have a temporary fall. Feel the divine within you. Open yourself fully to the divine influence.
Develop burning desire for the attainment of God-consciousness and burning dispassion
(Vairagya) for worldly enjoyments. Abandon all worldly ambitions and mundane desires. Soar
high always in the realms of higher spiritual knowledge. Show your manliness, moral courage and
spiritual strength now, O Ram!

Spiritual life is not mere idle talk. It is not mere sensation. It is actual living in Atman. It is a

transcendental experience of unalloyed bliss.

May you all become immortal and drink deep the divine nectar of perennial joy and eternal

bliss!

LIVE IN GOD

also. That creator is GOD.

There is a maker for a pot or a table. So, there must be a creator for this marvellous world

God is the wire-puller (Sutradhara) standing behind the machine of this world. He is the
indweller of your heart. He presides over all actions (Karma-dhyaksha). He is the dispenser of the
fruits of your actions. Live in God by singing His name, repeating His Mantra and surrendering the
fruits of your actions unto Him.

The Lord abides in every creature. Behold the Lord in all objects, in all manifestations. He is
in the breath, in the voice, in the eyes. He is the Life of your life, Soul of your soul. Make no
distinction between a Hindu and a Mussalman, a Protestant and a Catholic, a Saivite and a
Vaishnavite.

Within you is the hidden God. Within you is the immortal soul. Within you is the
inexhaustible spiritual treasure. Within you is the fountain of joy and happiness. Within you is the
ocean of bliss. Look within for the happiness you have sought in vain in the perishable sensual
objects. Rest peacefully in your own Atma and drink the nectar of Immortality.

Insure your life with God. Depend upon Him alone. All other insurance companies will fail,
but this Divine Company will never fail. You need not pay any premium to this Divine Company.
You will have to love God only. You will have to give Him your heart.

Satyam (truth) is the seed. Brahmacharya (celibacy) is the root. Meditation is the shower.
Santi (peace) is the flower. Moksha (salvation) is the fruit. Therefore, speak truth. Practise
Brahmacharya and meditation. Cultivate Santi. You will surely attain the final emancipation or
freedom from the trammels of births and deaths and enjoy eternal bliss, supreme peace, perennial
joy and immortality.

Surrender everything unto Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at ease. He will take
complete charge of you. Let Him mould you in any way He likes. Let Him do exactly as He wills.
He will remove all defects and weaknesses. He will play beautifully in this body flute. Hear the
marvellous music of the flute of the Lord(cid:151)the mysterious music of the soul(cid:151)and rejoice.

Peace is a divine attribute. It is a quality of the soul. It cannot remain with greedy persons. It
fills the pure heart. It is a sweet companion of sages and Yogins. It deserts the lustful. It runs away
from the selfish. It is an ornament of a Paramahamsa.

(cid:147)As you think, so you become.(cid:148) This is the immutable psychological law. Your thoughts
make your life. You can choose your thoughts. You can choose your mode of thinking. You can
make your life as you choose. If you entertain evil thoughts, you will lead a miserable life. If you
cultivate sublime thoughts, you will attain Godhead.

39

May you all prosper gloriously! May you all lead the divine life singing Hari(cid:146)s Name,
serving the poor and the sick with Atma Bhava, sharing what you have with others and melting the
mind in the Lord through silent meditation!

ESSENCE OF YOGA

UNIVERSAL LOVE

The only Sara Vastu in this world is Prema or love. It is eternal, infinite and undecaying.
Physical love is passion or Moha or infatuation. Universal love is divine love. Cosmic love, Visva
Prema, universal love are synonymous terms. God is Love. Love is God. Selfishness, greed,
egoism, vanity, pride and hatred contract the heart and stand in the way of developing universal
love.

Develop universal love gradually through selfless service, Satsanga (association with
Mahatmas), prayer, recitation of Guru Mantra, etc. When the heart is contracted through
selfishness, man loves his wife, children, a few friends and relations only, in the beginning. As he
evolves, he loves the people of his own district, then the people of his own province. Later on, he
develops love for men of his own country. Eventually he begins to love people of different
countries. In the long run, he begins to love all. He develops universal love. All the barriers are
broken now. Heart expands infinitely.

It is very easy to talk of universal love. But when you want to put it in actual practice, it
becomes extremely difficult. Petty-mindedness of all sorts comes in the way. Old, wrong
Samskaras (impressions) which you have created by your wrong mode of life in past, act as
stumbling blocks. Through iron determination, strong will-power, patience, perseverance and
Vichara (right enquiry), you can conquer all obstacles quite easily. The grace of the Lord will
descend on you if you are sincere, my dear friends!

Universal love terminates in Advaitic unity or oneness or Upanishadic consciousness of
Seers and Sages. Pure love is a great leveller. It brings equality. Hafiz, Kabir, Mira, Gouranga,
Tukaram, Ramdas, all have tasted this universal love. What others have achieved, you can also
attain.

Feel that the whole world is your body, your own home. Melt or destroy all barriers that
separate man from man. Idea of superiority is ignorance or delusion. Develop Visvaprema,
all-embracing love. Unite with all. Separation is death. Unite in eternal life. Feel that the whole
world is Visvabrindavan. Feel that this body is a moving temple of God. Wherever you are, whether
at home, office, railway station or market, feel that you are in the temple. Consecrate every act as an
offering unto the Lord. Transmute every work into Yoga by offering its fruits to God. Have
Akartri-Sakshi Bhava, if you are a student of Vedanta. Have Nimitta Bhava, if you are a student of
Bhakti Marga. Feel that all beings are images of God. Isa-Vasyamidam Sarvam(cid:151)this world is
indwelt by the Lord. Feel that one power or God works through all hands, sees through all eyes,
hears through all ears. You will become a changed being. You will enjoy the highest peace and
bliss.

May Lord Hari take you all to His bosom and bathe you with the waters of sweet love!

May your heart be filled with cosmic love!

PRACTICE OF MEDITATION

Meditation is the only royal road to the attainment of salvation or Moksha. Meditation kills
all pains, sufferings, the three kinds of Taapas (fevers) and the five Kleshas (sorrows). Meditation
gives the vision of unity. Meditation produces sense of oneness. Meditation is an aeroplane that
helps the aspirant to soar high in the realms of eternal bliss and everlasting peace. It is a mysterious
ladder that connects earth and heaven and takes the aspirant to the immortal abode of Brahman.

Meditation is the continuous flow of one thought of God or Atman, like the continuous flow

of oil from one vessel to another (Tailadharavat). Meditation follows Concentration.

Practise meditation in the early morning from 4 to 6 (Brahma-Muhurta). This is the best

time for the practice of meditation.

Sit on Padma or Siddha or Sukha Asana. Keep the head, neck and the trunk in a straight line.
Concentrate either on the Trikuti(cid:151)the space between the two eyebrows(cid:151)or in the heart, with
closed eyes.

Meditation is of two kinds, viz., Saguna Dhyana (concrete meditation) and Nirguna Dhyana
(abstract meditation). In concrete meditation the Yogi student meditates on the form of Sri Krishna,
Rama, Sita, Vishnu, Siva, Gayatri or Devi. In abstract meditation, he meditates on his own Self or
Atman.

Place the picture of Lord Hari with Chaturbhuja in front of you. Gaze at this picture steadily
for five minutes, then close the eyes and visualise the picture. During visualisation move the mind
on the various parts of Vishnu. See with the mind His feet first, then in the following order: His legs,
His yellow silk cloth, His golden necklace set with Kaustubha gem on the breast, the earring
Makara Kundala, then the face, then the crown on the head, then the disc in the right upper hand,
then the conch in the left upper hand, then the mace in the lower right hand, then the lotus in the
lower left hand. Then come down to the feet and repeat the process again and again. Finally fix the
mind either at the feet or the face. Repeat the Mantra mentally: (cid:147)Hari Om(cid:148) or (cid:147)Om Namo
Narayanaya(cid:148). Think of the attributes of the Lord such as Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Purity, etc.

Meditate on Om and its meaning with feeling. This is Nirguna Dhyana. Repeat Om
mentally. Identify yourself with Atman. Feel, (cid:147)I am the all-pervading immortal Self or Atman. I am
Sat-Chit-Ananda Brahman. I am Sakshi or silent witness of three states and all modifications of the
mind. I am pure consciousness. I am distinct from the body, mind, Prana and senses. I am the
self-luminous Light of lights. I am the Eternal Supreme Soul.

If you have contentment, cheerfulness, patience, unruffled state of mind, sweet voice,
one-pointedness of mind, light body, fearlessness, desirelessness, disgust for worldly things, know
that you are advancing in the spiritual path and that you are nearing God.

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Be regular in your meditation. Regularity is the key to success. Regularity is of paramount
importance. May you all be established in Samadhi (superconscious state of bliss) through regular
meditation!

THY REAL NATURE

Religion is faith for knowing and worshipping God. It is not a matter for discussion at a club
table. It is the perception and realisation of the True Self. It is the fulfilment of the deepest craving in
man. Therefore, hold religion as the goal of your life. Live every second of your life for its
realisation. Life without religion is real death.

Analyse your thoughts. Scrutinize your motives. Remove selfishness. Calm the passions.
Control the Indriyas. Destroy egoism. Serve and love all. Purify your heart. Cleanse the dross of
your mind. Hear and reflect. Concentrate and meditate. Attain Self-realisation.

There is something dearer than wealth. There is something dearer than your wife. There is
something dearer than your children. There is something dearer than your life itself. That dearest
something is thy own Self (Atman)(cid:151)Inner Ruler (Antaryamin), Immortal (Amritam). This
Immortal Self can be realised by incessant practice of meditation.

O Saumya! Dear Immortal Self! Be bold: Be cheerful, even though you are unemployed,
though you are clad in rags. Thy essential nature is
though you have nothing to eat,
Sat-Chit-Ananda. The outer cloak, this mortal physical sheath is an illusory production of Maya.
Smile, whistle, laugh, jump, dance in joy and ecstasy. Sing Om Om Om! Ram Ram Ram! Come out
of this cage of flesh. Thou art sexless Atma. Thou art that Atma who dwells in the chambers of your
heart. Act as such. Feel as such. Claim your birthright, not from tomorrow or the day after, but right
now from this very second. (cid:147)Tat Tvam Asi(cid:151)Thou art That(cid:148). Feel, Assert, Recognise, Realise, my
beloved Ram!

Find out your centre. Dwell always in this centre. This centre is the abode of Supreme Bliss
and Eternal Sunshine. This centre is the Param Dham or Paramagati or Supreme Goal. This centre is
your sweet original home, the abode of immortality and fearlessness. This centre is Atma or
Brahman. This is the Imperishable Brahmic seat of ineffable splendour and glory!

DIVINE LIFE

Divine life is life in God or the Immortal Soul. He who leads the divine life is free from
cares, worries, anxieties, miseries, sufferings and tribulations. He attains immortality, perfection,
freedom, independence, eternal peace, supreme bliss and perennial joy. He radiates joy, peace and
light everywhere.

To lead the divine life, you need not retire into forests. You can lead the divine life, while
remaining in the world. What is wanted is renunciation of egoism, mineness, attachment, Vasanas
and Trishnas. Give the mind to God and the hands to the service of humanity.

42

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

Serve humanity with Atma Bhava. Serve the poor. Serve the sick with Narayana Bhava.
Serve the society. Serve the country. Selfless service is the highest Yoga. Samadhi will come by
itself without any effort for one, who is solely absorbed in service, when his heart is purified.
Service is worship of the Lord. Never forget this. He who sees Brahman or the Immortal Soul in the
spoon, Brahman in the medicine, Brahman in the patient, Brahman in the doctor, Brahman in
service, he who thinks or meditates thus, while doing service, verily reaches Brahman or the
Eternal.

The practice of Brahmacharya is very important for spiritual progress. Brahmacharya is the
basis for acquiring immortality. It is itself divine life. Brahmacharya brings material progress and
psychic advancement. It is a substratum for a life of peace in Atma. It is a potent weapon for
controlling the internal Rajasic forces, viz., Kama, Krodha, Lobha, etc. It gives tremendous energy
and gigantic will power and good Vichara Sakti.

Japa is an important Anga of Yoga or divine life. A Mantra is divinity. Japa is the repetition
of the Mantra or the names of the Lord. In Kali Yuga, practice of Japa alone can give eternal peace,
bliss and immortality. Japa ultimately results in Samadhi or communion with the Lord.

Sankirtan is the singing of Lord(cid:146)s names with faith and devotion. When you sing His names,
feel that Lord Hari or Ishta Devata is seated in your heart, that every name of the Lord is filled with
divine potencies, that the old vicious Samskaras and Vasanas are burnt by the power of the name
and that the mind is filled with Sattva or purity, that Rajas and Tamas are completely destroyed, and
that the veil of ignorance is torn down. This kind of mental attitude brings the maximum benefit of
Sankirtan. It is not the number of Japa or the length of time of Kirtan that counts for spiritual growth
but it is the intensity of Bhava with which the Lord(cid:146)s names are sung.

DIVINE MESSAGE

Pure as the snow of the Himalayas, bright as sunlight, expansive as the sky, all-pervading as
the ether; unfathomable as the ocean, cool as the waters of the Ganges, is the Immortal Atman(cid:151)the
substratum for this world, body, mind and Prana. Nothing is sweeter than this Atman.

Purify your heart and meditate. Plunge deep in your heart. Dive deep into the innermost
recess. You will find it. Only if you search in deep water, you will find the pearl of Atman. If you
keep to the shore, you will find broken shells only.

The best flower that can be offered to the Lord is your heart. Penetrate more deeply into the

infinite domain of Kailas, the kingdom of illimitable bliss and boundless joy and peace within.

Just as the light is burning within the hurricane lantern, so also, the divine light is burning
within the heart. You can behold the divine light through your inner third eye or the eye of intuition
by withdrawing the senses and stilling the mind.

It takes a long time for charcoal to catch fire but gunpowder can be ignited within the
twinkling of an eye. Even so, it takes a long time for igniting the fire of knowledge for a man whose

43

ESSENCE OF YOGA

heart is impure. But an aspirant with great purity of heart gets knowledge of the Self, within the
twinkling of an eye with the time taken to squeeze a flower by the fingers.

Armed with patience, perseverance, tranquillity and courage, slowly ascend, peak after
peak, subdue the Indriyas one by one, control the thoughts one by one, eradicate the Vasanas one by
one and eventually reach the summit of Self-realisation or Divine Glory.

O friend! Wake up. Sleep no more. Meditate. It is Brahmamuhurta now. Open the gate of
the temple of the Lord in your heart with the key of love. Hear the music of the soul. Sing the song of
Prema to your beloved. Play the melody of the Infinite. Melt your mind in His contemplation. Unite
with Him. Immerse yourself in the ocean of Love and Bliss.

SELF-ANALYSIS

Daily self-analysis or self-examination is an indispensable requisite. Then alone can you
remove your defects and can grow rapidly in spirituality. A gardener watches the young plants very
carefully. He removes the weeds daily. He puts a strong fence around them. He waters them at the
proper time. Then alone they grow beautifully and yield fruits quickly. Even so, you should find out
your defects through daily introspection and self-analysis and then eradicate them through suitable
methods. If one method fails, you must adopt a combined method. If prayer fails, you should take
recourse to Satsanga or association with the wise, Pranayama, meditation, dietetic regulation,
enquiry, etc. You should destroy not only big waves of pride, hypocrisy, lust, anger, etc., that
manifest on the surface of the conscious mind, but also their subtle impressions which lurk in the
corners of the subconscious mind. Then only are you perfectly safe.

These subtle impressions are very dangerous. They lurk like thieves and attack you when
you are napping, when you are not vigilant, when your dispassion wanes, when you slacken a bit
your daily spiritual practice, and when you are provoked. If these defects do not manifest even
under extreme provocation on several occasions, even when you are not practising daily
introspection and self-analysis, you can be rest assured that the subtle impressions also are
obliterated. Now you are safe. The practice of introspection and self-analysis demands patience,
perseverance, leech-like tenacity, application, iron will, iron determination, subtle intellect,
courage, etc. But you will gain a fruit of incalculable value. The precious fruit is immortality,
Supreme Peace and Infinite Bliss. You will have to pay a heavy price for this. Therefore you should
not murmur when you do daily practice. You should apply your full mind, heart, intellect and soul
to spiritual practice. Then only rapid success is possible.

Keep daily spiritual diary and practise self-analysis (self-examination) at night. Note down
how many good actions you have done, what mistakes you have committed during the course of the
day. In the morning resolve: (cid:147)I will not yield to anger today. I will practise celibacy today. I will
speak truth today.(cid:148)

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING A SPIRITUAL DIARY

The keeping up of a daily spiritual diary is an indispensable requisite and of paramount
importance. Those who are already in the habit of keeping it know its incalculable advantages.
Diary is a whip for goading the mind towards God. It shows the way to freedom and eternal bliss. It
is your Guru. It is the eye-opener. It develops the Manana-Sakti or the power of reflection. It will
help you to destroy all your evil qualities and to be regular in your spiritual practices. If you
regularly maintain a diary, you will get solace, peace of mind and quick progress in the spiritual
path. Those who desire to grow in morality and spirituality, those who wish to evolve rapidly must
keep a daily record of their actions.

All great men of the world keep diaries. The life of Benjamin Franklin is known to you all.
He kept a daily diary. He noted down the number of untruths and wrong actions for which he was
responsible during the course of the day. In course of time, he became a perfect man. He had perfect
control over his mind. Mahatma Gandhi used to advise the students to keep a daily diary always.

A big thief is hiding himself in your brain. He has snatched away your Atmic pearl. He is
giving you immense worries and troubles. He is deluding you. The thief is your mind. You must not
be lenient towards him. You must kill him ruthlessly. There is no other sword sharper than this diary
to kill him. It checks his happy-go-lucky ways and destroys him eventually. All your daily mistakes
will be corrected. A good time will come when you will be entirely free from anger, untruth, lust,
etc. You will become a perfect Yogi.

Your father and mother gave you this body. They gave you food and clothing. But this diary
is superior to your parents. It shows the way to freedom and eternal bliss. It gives you solace,
satisfaction and peace of mind. Turn the pages of your diary carefully once a week. If you can
record your actions every hour, your growth will be rapid. Happy is the man who keeps a daily diary
for he is very near to God. He has a strong will and he is free from defects and mistakes.

By keeping a spiritual diary you can then and there rectify your mistakes. You can do more
Sadhana and evolve quickly. There is no other best friend and faithful teacher or Guru than your
diary. It will teach you the value of time. At the end of every month calculate the total number of
hours you spent in Japa, study of religious books, Pranayama, Asanas, sleep, etc. Then you will be
able to know how much time You are spending for religious purposes. You have got every chance
to increase the period of Japa, meditation, etc., gradually. If you maintain a daily diary properly,
without any fault in any of the items, you will not like to waste even a single minute unnecessarily.
Then alone will you understand the value of time and how it slips away.

Compare the total of the last month with those of the previous months. Find out whether you
have progressed in your Sadhana or not. If you have not progressed, increase your practice daily.
You can do more Sadhana and evolve quickly.

In maintaining a diary, you should not utter any falsehood anywhere. You are keeping it
only for your own benefit. It is the diary of a religious aspirant who is treading the path of truth to
realise Truth. Acknowledge your faults openly and endeavour to rectify yourself in future. You
should not neglect to record everything in your diary. It is better if you compare the progress of your

45

ESSENCE OF YOGA

work of the present week with that of the previous week. If you are not able to do so once a week,
you must at any cost compare it once a month. Then you will be able to make various adjustments in
different items, increase the period of Japa and meditation and decrease the time of sleep.

Self-punishment consists in giving up the night meals and in doing fifty Malas of Japa more
than the usual number. The filling in of the form should not be a mere routine work. The annexed
form is only a specimen for guidance. These items should be copied on a foolscap size paper neatly
with columns drawn for all the days of the month.

Do not be ashamed to mention your mistakes, vices and failures. This is meant only for your
own progress. Do not waste your precious hours. It is enough that you have wasted so many years in
idle gossiping. Enough, enough of the troubles you had all these days in satisfying your senses. Do
not say, (cid:147)From tomorrow, I will be regular.(cid:148) That (cid:147)tomorrow(cid:148) will never come. Be sincere and start
doing Sadhana from this moment. If you are really sincere, He is ever ready to help you and give
you a push in your spiritual march.

He who regulates his life on the above lines is sure to become a Jivanmukta or a Yogi in this
very birth. Do it practically and see how you grow. Start maintaining a spiritual diary from this
moment itself and realise the marvellous results.

SPIRITUAL DIARY

1. When did you get up from bed?

(cid:147)Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.(cid:148) You must get up at 4
a.m., and practise Japa and meditation. The meditative state of the mind will come by itself without
exertion at this period.

2. How many hours did you sleep?

Sleep for six hours is quite sufficient for every individual. Go to bed at 10 p.m., and get up at
4 a.m. Napoleon Bonaparte believed in only four hours of sleep. Too much sleep makes a man dull
and lethargic. Too much sleep causes premature decay and weakens the brain-power. Those
spiritual aspirants who want to do rigorous Sadhana should reduce the sleep gradually. For three
months reduce the sleep by half an hour. During the next three months go to bed at 11 p.m., and get
up at 4 a.m. In this way you can conquer sleep and become one like Arjuna or Lakshmana.

3. How many Malas of Japa?

Japa is an important limb of Yoga. In this Kali Yuga, Japa and Kirtan are effective Sadhanas
for God-realisation. Japa results in Samadhi or communion with God. Japa is the repetition of the
name of the Lord. There are three varieties of Japa, viz., Vaikhari (verbal), Upamsu (whispering),
and Manasic (mental). Have a Japa Mala (rosary) round your neck or in your pocket or underneath
your pillow at night. Use a Mala of 108 beads. A Mala is a whip to goad the mind towards God. The
fruits of Manasic Japa are ten thousand times more than Vaikhari or Upamsu. Always try to do

46

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

mental Japa when you are busy in daily activities. Make it a point to repeat the Mantra some
thousand times and record the number in the diary.

4. How long in Kirtan?

Repetition of God(cid:146)s name enables the devotee to feel the divine presence, the divine glory
and the divine consciousness within himself and also everywhere. How powerful is God(cid:146)s name!
When one sings His name or hears its sound, he is unconsciously raised to sublime spiritual heights.
He loses his body-consciousness. He is immersed in joy and drinks deep the divine nectar of
immortality. Sankirtan is singing God(cid:146)s name with Bhava and Prema or divine feeling. Sankirtan
brings Darshan of God or attainment of divine consciousness easily in this Kali Yuga.

5. How many Pranayamas?

Pranayama is (cid:145)control of breath(cid:146). Sit in Padmasana, Sukhasana, or any other comfortable
pose, with an empty stomach. Close your eyes. Close the right nostril with the thumb. Draw in the
air very very slowly through the left nostril. Now close your left nostril with the little and right
fingers, and retain the breath as long as you can comfortably keep. Then very very slowly exhale
through the right nostril after removing the thumb. Again draw in the air through the right nostril
retain it as long as you can and exhale through the left nostril very slowly. This is one Pranayama.
To start with, do five Pranayamas in the morning and evening and gradually increase to 10 or 20.
This is Sukhapurvaka(cid:151)easy, comfortable Pranayama.

6. How long did you perform Asanas?

Asana is the first stage of Ashtanga Yoga. Padmasana and Siddhasana are intended for
doing Japa and meditation. Do not often change the Asana. Stick to one and gradually increase the
period to even three hours. Sirshasana, Sarvangasana and other exercises are intended for
maintaining good health. They remove various diseases. These Asanas will awaken the Kundalini
Sakti. Perform the Asanas when the stomach is empty or light. Early morning and evening are very
good for the practice of Asanas. Practise the Asanas in well-ventilated room or on the sandy beds of
rivers, open airy places, or seaside. During the practice repeat your Ishta or Guru Mantra.

7. How long did you meditate in one Asana?

Sit in Padmasana or Sukhasana in your meditation room. Early morning between 4 and 6 is
the best period for contemplation and Japa. You can have another sitting in the night also. Take your
seat before the picture of your Ishta Devata. Look at the picture steadily for a few minutes. Repeat
some Stotras mentally. Then close your eyes and visualise the picture. Repeat the Ishta Mantra
mentally. Sit for meditation for half an hour in the beginning and try to increase the period to three
hours by gradual daily practice. When you sit on your Asana for meditation, do not shake the body.
Try to keep up one current of thought of God.

47

ESSENCE OF YOGA

8. How many Gita Slokas did you read or get by heart?

Study of scriptures is Kriya Yoga or Niyama. It purifies the heart and fills the mind with
sublime and elevating thoughts. Gita is a unique book for Svadhyaya. It contains the essence of all
the Yogas and the cream of the Vedas. You can devote half an hour to three hours for this purpose
according to the time at your disposal.

9. How long in the company of the wise (Satsanga)?

The glory and power of Satsanga or association with the wise, Saints, Yogins, Sannyasins
and Mahatmas, is described in detail in Bhagavata, Ramayana, and other holy scriptures. Even a
moment(cid:146)s company is quite sufficient to overhaul the old vicious Samskaras of the people. Service
to Mahatmas purifies the mind of passionate men rapidly. Satsanga elevates the mind to
magnanimous heights. Study of books written by realised persons will also be tantamount to
Satsanga.

10. How many hours did you observe Mouna?

Monna means vow of silence. Energy is wasted in idle talking and gossiping. Mouna
develops will-power. Mouna checks the impulse of speech. It is a great help for the observance of
truth and control of anger. Emotions are controlled and irritability vanishes. Observe Mouna at least
for one hour or two hours a day. During Mouna, sublime thoughts should replace worldly thoughts
and Japa should be done.

11. How long in disinterested selfless service?

The practice of Nishkama Karma Yoga destroys sins and impurities of the mind and causes
Chitta Suddhi or purity of Antahkarana. Knowledge of Self dawns in a pure mind. Knowledge of
Self is the only direct means to freedom. Nishkama Karma Yoga is selfless service to humanity.
The important point is to serve humanity without any attachment or egoism. The central teaching of
the Gita is non-attachment to work. Sri Krishna says: (cid:147)Work incessantly. Your duty is to work but
not to expect the fruits thereof.(cid:148) Do vigorous service for some time. You will grasp the spirit of
Nishkama Karma.

12. How much did you give in charity?

When you walk along the road or street, keep always some loose coins in your pocket and
distribute them to the poor. Be liberal. Feel that you are enjoying in all the bodies. Your heart will
expand. You will begin to realise unity or oneness. You will become more generous. Do regular
charity of one tenth of your income. Performance of virtuous actions is the beginning of spiritual
life.

13. How many Mantras did you write?

Maintain a Mantra notebook. Write your Ishta Mantra, Guru Mantra or Maha Mantra for
half an hour in this notebook. You should preferably do this item of Sadhana just before the

48

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

commencement of the household duties. You should observe Mouna or silence while writing the
Mantra. There should be perfect calm and quietude. You should concentrate on the writing alone. In
Mantra writing, the eyes, the hands and the mind are all engaged. There is no restriction of
language. If this practice is continued with sincerity, the aspirant gets concentration easily and
much internal peace and happiness.

14. How long did you practise physical exercise?

Physical culture or the development of the body is as much important as the development of
the mind, will, or memory. If the body is not kept strong and healthy, vigorous and active, no culture
is possible. (cid:147)Mens sana in corpore sano(cid:148) is a wise saying which means(cid:151)a sound mind in a sound
body. There are different kinds of physical culture. You will have to select one according to your
capacity, taste and temperament.

15.How many lies did you tell and with what Self-punishment?

Srutis emphatically declare: (cid:147)Satyam Vada(cid:151)Speak the Truth(cid:148). (cid:147)Satyameva Jayate
Nanritam(cid:151)Truth alone triumphs but not falsehood(cid:148). A truthful man is absolutely free from
worries and anxieties. He has a calm mind. He is respected by all. If you observe speaking the truth
for twelve years, you will have Vak-Siddhi. Then whatever you speak will come to pass. Speak the
truth. Truth is Knowledge. Truth is Bliss. Truth guides you in all your actions. Write in bold types
the words: (cid:147)Speak Truth(cid:148) on cardboards and hang them in different places in your house. This will
remind you when you speak a lie. You will check yourself at once. Punish yourself by fasting if you
tell a lie and record the lies in the diary. Gradually the number of lies will decrease and you will
become a truthful man.

16.How many times and how long of anger and with what self-punishment?

Anger is an enemy to peace. It is a modification of lust. When a desire is not gratified, a man
becomes angry. He loses his memory and understanding. Control anger by the practice of Kshama,
love and killing egoism. Drink a little water when you become angry. It will cool the brain and calm
the excited nerves. Repeat (cid:147)Om Santi(cid:148) several times. If you find it extremely difficult to control
anger, leave the place immediately and take a walk for half an hour. Pray to God. Do Japa.
Meditation gives immense strength to destroy anger and other obstacles.

17.How many hours did you spend in useless company?

The so-called friends are real enemies. You cannot find even a single unselfish friend in this
universe. Be careful. Friends come to have idle talks with you and they waste your time. They want
to pull you down and make you also worldly. Do not be carried away by the flowery speech of such
friends. Cut off connections ruthlessly. Live alone at all times. Trust in that immortal friend who
dwells in your heart. If you cannot have positive Satsanga of Mahatmas, have indirect Satsanga
with books written by realised Sages, Saints and Bhagavatas.

49

ESSENCE OF YOGA

18. How many times did you fail in Brahmacharya?

No spiritual progress is possible without the practice of celibacy. Veerya is a dynamic force.
It should be converted into Ojas-Sakti. Those who are very eager to have God-realisation should
observe unbroken celibacy strictly. Observe the vow of Brahmacharya strictly.

19. How long in study of religious books?

Be regular in the study of religious books, Ramayana, Bhagavata, Yoga Vasishtha and other
good books, for Svadhyaya. If you reflect on the ideas of Gita and fix the mind on these ideas, this
itself is a form of lower Samadhi. Svadhyaya is an auxiliary for concentration. Svadhyaya will
check mind-wandering also.

20.How many times did you fail in the control of evil habits and with what self-punishment?

There are some who are unconscious of their bad habits and many who do not recognise
them as bad. If they recognise them to be bad, then the correction is very simple. Alcohol is a strong
devil, which if once enters the system of a man will never leave him. Then comes, smoking.
Another evil habit is betel-chewing. Drinking of strong tea and coffee often develops a bad habit.
Novel reading, visiting cinemas, sleeping in the daytime, using slang terms and abuses, etc., are
some of the evil habits. First realise that you have got an evil habit and intensely desire that you
should give it up at any cost. Then your success has already come. Giving up any bad habit at once is
better. Use your subconscious mind for eradication. Establish new healthy habits and develop your
will. There is nothing impossible under the Sun.

21.How long you did concentrate on your Ishta Devata (Saguna or Nirguna Dhyana)?

Concentration can be done only if you are free from all distractions. Concentrate on
anything that appeals to you as good or anything which the mind likes best. The mind should be
trained to concentrate on gross objects in the beginning and, later on, you can successfully
concentrate on subtle objects and abstract ideas. Regularity in the practice is of paramount
importance.

Gross Forms: Concentrate on a black dot on the wall or a candle-flame, a bright star, moon,
on the picture of Om, Lord Siva, Rama, Krishna, Devi, or your Ishta Devata in front of you with
open eyes.

Subtle Forms: Sit before the picture of your Ishta Devata and close your eyes. Keep a mental
picture of your Ishta Devata at the space between the two eyebrows, or heart (Anahata Chakra);
concentrate on Muladhara, Anahata, Ajna or any other internal Chakra; concentrate on the divine
qualities such as love, mercy, or any other abstract ideas, Sat Chit Ananda, purity, perfection, peace.

22.How many days did you observe fast and vigil?

Keeping wide awake throughout the night is called vigil. You will derive incalculable
benefit if you practise vigil on Vaikuntha-Ekadasi, Sivaratri, Gokulashtami day (the birthday of Sri

50

SPIRITUAL SADHANA

Krishna). Complete fasting helps to control the sleep. Control of sleep by taking recourse to tea is
not desirable. You will not gain spiritual strength as you depend upon an extraneous drug. During
fasting avoid company. Live alone. Utilise your time in Yogic Sadhana. After a fast, do not take any
heavy food. Milk or some fruit-juice is beneficial.

23. Were you regular in your meditation?

Never miss a day in meditation. Be regular and systematic. Regularity in meditation is of
paramount importance. The meditative state will come by itself at the appointed time. Take Sattvic
food. Fruits and milk will help mental focussing. When the mind is tired, do not concentrate. Give it
a little rest.

24. What virtues are you developing?

Develop that virtue in which you are hopelessly lacking. Courage, mercy, universal love,
nobility, Kshama, contentment, frankness and honesty must be developed one by one. Take up one
virtue every month and meditate on that virtue regularly. You will manifest that virtue in your
character. If you develop one important virtue, all other virtues will cling to you. If you have
humility and courage, all other virtues will come of their own accord. You should spend daily some
time, say half an hour, for development of virtues.

25.What evil quality are you trying to eradicate?

The development of virtuous qualities will itself remove the negative qualities. But it is
better to make a positive attempt also in the eradication of the evil qualities. Then the progress will
be rapid. It is a double attack on the enemy. If you remove lust or anger or egoism, all other evil
qualities will disappear by themselves. All evil qualities are the attendants of egoism. All vices
originate from anger. If these are destroyed, all sorts of vices will vanish. Therefore, concentrate
your attention in killing egoism or anger.

26. Which Indriya is troubling you most?

Discipline of the Indriyas is a very important point. If the Indriyas are turbulent, you cannot
have concentration. Watch every Indriya carefully and curb it by suitable methods, such as fasting,
Mouna, Tratak, celibacy, renunciation of articles, Dama and Pratyahara. Curbing of Indriyas means
curbing of mind. They cannot do any independent work without the direct help of the mind.
Celibacy checks the genitals; Mouna will control the organ of speech; Tratak controls the eyes.
Sufficient practice for a long time is necessary. Then the Indriyas become emaciated and thin and
are starved to death.

27. When did you go to bed?

Sleep is nature(cid:146)s tonic, for healthy living. The more sound sleep one has, the more healthy
he would be. Hours of sleep depend upon your physical or mental capacity for resisting fatigue.
Without a sufficiency of sleep, you will not have efficiency. The amount of sleep required varies
with age, temperament and amount of work. According to an old adage there should be six hours(cid:146)

51

ESSENCE OF YOGA

sleep for a man, seven for a woman and eight for a fool. As age advances, people require more sleep.
Avoid going late to bed. Do not take drugs to induce sleep. If you do not get sleep, take a brisk walk
in the open air for fifteen minutes and then go to bed. You will have refreshing sleep.

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR DESTINY

Courage is thy birthright, but not fear; peace is thy divine heritage, but not restlessness.
Immortality is thy birthright, but not mortality; strength, but not weakness; health, but not disease;
bliss, but not sorrow; knowledge, but not ignorance.

Pain, sorrow and ignorance are illusory; these cannot live. Bliss, joy and knowledge are

true; these cannot die.

You are the architect of your own fate. You are the master of your own destiny. You can do
and undo things. You sow an action and reap a tendency. You sow a tendency and reap a habit. You
sow a habit and reap your character. You sow your character and reap your destiny. Therefore,
destiny is your own creation. You can undo it if you like(cid:151)destiny is a bundle of habits.

Purushartha is self-exertion. Purushartha can give you anything. Change your habits.
Change the mode of thinking. You can conquer destiny. You are now thinking: (cid:147)I am the body.(cid:148)
Start the spiritual anti-current and think: (cid:147)I am immortal, diseaseless, sexless Atman.(cid:148) You can
conquer death and attain the immortal seat of supreme splendour.

By virtuous deeds and right thoughts you can disarm destiny. You have a free-will to act. By
self-exertion, Ratnakar became Valmiki. By self-exertion, Markandeya conquered death. By
self-exertion alone did Uddalaka attain Nirvikalpa Samadhi (higher realisation). By self-exertion,
Savitri brought back her husband (Satyavan) to life.

Therefore, apply yourself tenaciously, O Prema, to Atmic enquiry and meditation. Be
vigilant and diligent. Kill the thoughts and desires. Overcome tomorrow(cid:146)s evil by today(cid:146)s
self-exertion. Destroy unholy desires (Asubha Vasanas) through holy desires (Subha Vasanas).
Slay unholy thoughts by holy thoughts, and gain victory over your destiny.

Do not yield to fatalism. Do not become impotent. Stand like a lion. Exert and attain
independence or Atma Svarajya. There is a magazine of power within you. There is a vast ocean of
knowledge within you. All faculties are latent in you. Unfold them and become a Jivanmukta
(liberated soul).

Positive overcomes the negative. This is the immutable law of nature. Purushartha
(self-exertion) is a mightier power. Purushartha is the lion or the elephant. Prarabdha (destiny) is
the cat or the jackal. God helps those who help themselves. Vasishtha asked Rama to do
Purushartha. Fatalism will certainly induce inertia and laziness. Therefore, gird up your loins and
exert yourself to the utmost, O Prema.

54

May you all attain Self-realisation or Brahma Jnana in this very birth! May you all live

immersed in the ocean of bliss in an illumined state! May you shine as liberated sages!

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

KNOW THYSELF

That (cid:145)Being(cid:146) who is described in the Upanishads is Brahman or Atman or the Absolute. He
is the fountain-head of all scriptural knowledge. He is the source or womb for everything. He is
Existence Absolute, Knowledge Absolute and Bliss Absolute. He is indivisible, all-pervading,
self-contained, eternal and immortal. He is beyond time, space and causation. He is beginningless
and endless. He is the indweller of all beings. He is the witness of the activities of all the minds.

What on earth can cause fear in you when you have realised identity with Brahman? What
on earth can generate hatred, delusion, difference and sorrow in you when you behold one in all, and
all in one? What on earth can cause agitation in you when you have transcended the mind and when
you rest peacefully in your own Sat Chit Ananda Svarupa(cid:151)that magnanimous ocean of bliss and
stupendous silence?

You experience disharmony and discord when Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia) prevail
in the mind. Annihilate Tamas by increasing Rajas and destroy Rajas increasing Sattva. There will
be harmony and concord when Sattva prevails in the mind. Go beyond Sattva and hear the celestial
music of the Soul(cid:151)music that you never heard before. It is the music of the meeting of the soul with
Soul. It is the wonderful music that transcends all Ragas and Raginis. It is the unstruck music of the
Infinite(cid:151)that celestial melody which helps the aspirant to merge himself in Brahman. It is the
music of Om or Pranava Dhvani. It is transcendental Anahata sound. It is the divine music of
Krishna(cid:146)s flute. It is silence itself. Drown yourself in the bliss of the inner music of the soul. Its
melody and sweetness are beyonddescription. You should experience it yourself.

You are the real master or governor of the universe. You are bound to none. Feel the majesty
of yourself. Whatever your circumstances and environments may be, keep peaceful and happy.
Abandon all anxiety, fear and worry. Rest in your centre. Be self-poised, self-pleased and
self-contained. Sing Om. Chant Om. Meditate on Om. Realise the Self. Know the Self and be free.
Now the whole world will be a heaven or a paradise for you. You are the Lord of lords, the God of
all gods, the Emperor of emperors. You are in possession of the inexhaustible spiritual wealth. The
sum total of the pleasures of the whole world is but a mere drop when compared to the bliss you
enjoy now. You are the ocean of bliss now. What a magnificent state! Even the thousand-tongued
Adisesha cannot describe it.

MESSAGE OF AMRITA

Amrita Putra!

Are you always peaceful? Are you noble? Do you possess self-restraint? Are you endowed
with divine virtues? Are you free from ignorance? Do you possess knowledge of the Self? Have you
got illumination? Have you realised the immortal, pure Self? How do you stand before these
questions? If you have not got these things, then come, sit down and listen! Here is the message of

55

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Amrita for you all! Even if you practise a particle of this, you will go beyond death, sorrow and
pain.

Meditate always: (cid:147)I am pure consciousness, I am Sat-Chit-Ananda Brahman. I am
immutable, self-effulgent, immortal Self. I am the silent witness of the three states, viz., waking
state, dream state and deep sleep state. I am distinct from the body, mind, Prana and senses. I am
distinct from the five sheaths(cid:148). You will soon attain Self-realisation. You will attain knowledge of
the Self (Brahma Jnana).

It is bondage when you are attached to your wife, son, property or body, when you take the
body as the pure Self. It is liberation when you are not attached to any object of this world, when you
identify yourself with the pure, immortal Atman.

Whenever there is Kama (desire), there is no Rama; whenever there is Rama there is no
Kama. Whenever there is desire there is the world. Therefore, go beyond desire by cultivating
discrimination (Viveka) and dispassion (Vairagya) and meditating on Brahman or the Supreme Self
and be happy.

Live without the feeling of (cid:145)I-ness,(cid:146) and (cid:145)mine-ness(cid:146) and attachment. Restrain the senses.

Observe the rules of right conduct. Get purity of heart. Hear the truth. Abide in the Self. Be happy.

As soon as you realise that you are not this body, you become free from sorrow and death.
You are free from the bondage of Karma, from the fetters of desires, from the mirage of this
mundane life and its concomitant evils and miseries.

(cid:145)Soul(cid:146) or (cid:145)Supreme Self(cid:146) or (cid:145)Atma(cid:146) or (cid:145)Brahman(cid:146) is that abiding, constantly existing and
imperishable entity which is the basis of the world, which is indivisible, self-luminous, unchanging
and all-pervading, which is the silent witness or SakShi of the three states, viz., waking, dream and
deep sleep. The knower of this soul or Atma attains immortality and enters the abode of bliss and
nectar.

Brahman is real and eternal. This body is unreal and perishable. From the knowledge of Self
(Atma) and not-self (Anatma) springs the stream of immortality or the ancient wisdom of the seers
of the Upanishads.

Atma is the immortal substance or essence in man. Atma is the origin of thoughts, desires
and reasonings. Atma is spiritual because it is beyond matter and mind. It must be immortal because
it is spiritual. It is beyond time, space and causation. It is beginningless, endless, causeless and
infinite.

If you realise this immortal soul which is hidden in your heart and all these forms, if the
knots of Avidya (ignorance), Kama (desire) and Karma (action) are rent asunder, if the chain of
ignorance, viz., ignorance, non-discrimination, egoism, likes and dislikes, Karma, body, etc., is
broken, you will be freed from the rounds of births and deaths and enter the city of deathlessness.

56

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

The ignorant man only runs after sensual objects and falls into the mortal coils spread round
him. He lives in the midst of darkness. He falls again and again under the sway of the Lord of Death
(Yama). The way to Moksha is not apparent to him. He is deluded by the sensual pleasures of this
world. But the patient, thoughtful man of discrimination and dispassion does not crave for the
illusory pleasures of this world. He meditates on the Supreme Self and attains eternal bliss and
immortality.

Moksha is the summum bonum of life. Moksha is the fulfilment of the life(cid:146)s purpose. Life
ends in the earth plane when you attain Moksha, or liberation from births and deaths. The
realisation of your real object in life is freedom or Moksha. Moksha bestows on you eternal life of
undecaying bliss and perennial joy. Moksha is not annihilation. Moksha is the annihilation of this
little, self-arrogating ego only. Moksha is realisation of the identity of the individual soul with the
Supreme Soul. By annihilating this little self, you possess the whole of true universality. You attain
life eternal(cid:151)a fuller life.

If you have purity of mind and concentration, you can make the mind assume any Bhava
you like. If you think of mercy, your whole being will be saturated with mercy. If you think of
peace, the whole being will be filled with peace.

The spiritual path is doubtless beset with various difficulties. It is a razor path. The walk in
this path is like walking on the edge of a sharp razor. You will fall down several times, but you will
have to rise up quickly and walk again with more zeal, boldness and cheerfulness. Every stumbling
block will become a stepping-stone to success or ascent in the hill of spiritual knowledge. Every fall
will give you additional strength to rise up to a great height in the ladder of Yoga. Do not lose sight
of the goal. Do not miss the ideal. Do not be discouraged. You will soon get spiritual strength from
within. The Indweller will guide you and push you up. All saints and sages, all prophets and seers
had to pass through tremendous struggles and severe ordeals before they reached the goal. March
boldly, O fair youth, and reach the goal.

It is not true that only one attained Moksha or liberation, and none else can. History bears
evidence of many a Sankara having come into this world. If the past could produce Sankaras, why
not the future also? What one has achieved, can be achieved by others, also. This is the immutable
law of nature. Whosoever would attain the knowledge of Self like Yajnavalkya of Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad, like Uddalaka of Chhandogya Upanishad, will also attain Moksha or Immortality.

The way of the enlightened sages is sinless. The way to liberation or freedom or perfect
happiness and peace is through perfect purity of mind and heart, of every act, of character and life,
through self-restraint and control of mind, and through regular meditation on the pure
self-luminous, indivisible, all-pervading Self or Atman.

If you attain Self-realisation, all doubts will be rent asunder. Supreme contentment will ever
dwell in your heart. You will be purged of Rajas and Tamas. You will be ever peaceful and happy.
Therefore struggle hard to attain this rare state of supreme blessedness in this very birth.

57

ESSENCE OF YOGA

The flame of a lamp destroys immense darkness. Even so knowledge of Self destroys
ignorance or Avidya(cid:151)the root-cause of human sufferings and tribulations. Therefore, attain the
knowledge of the Self, get illumination and go about happily.

What is that by knowing which everything else will be known? What is that by attaining
which there will be no hankering after any other thing? What is that by realising which one becomes
immortal, fearless, desireless and rests in everlasting peace and happiness? It is Brahman or Atma
or the ultimate Truth which is the summum bonum of life. It is the Bhuma or intelligence or the
unconditioned. You can get real happiness, only by attaining this Bhuma or the Highest Self.

May you all live in the spirit of this message of Amrita! May you all be equipped with the
four means of salvation through the grace of the Lord! May you all attain Self-realisation in this
very birth!

VEDANTA

The term Veda is derived from the Sanskrit root. (cid:145)Vid(cid:146)(cid:151)to know. (cid:145)Anta(cid:146) means end. Thus
Vedanta literally signifies (cid:147)end of wisdom.(cid:148) Philosophy is called Vedanta, because, it explains
what that end is and how to achieve it. Vedanta is the religion of the Vedas or the Upanishads. It is
the only universal, eternal religion. It is the essence of the teachings of the Srutis.

Vedanta is that bold philosophy which teaches unity of life or oneness of consciousness. It is
that supreme philosophy which boldly proclaims, with emphasis and force, that this little Jiva or
human being is identical with the Supreme Soul or the Eternal. It is that sublime philosophy which
elevates the mind at once to the magnificent heights of Brahmanhood, divine splendour and glory,
which makes you absolutely fearless, which destroys all barriers that separate man from man, and
which brings concord, unruffled peace and harmony to the suffering humanity at large. It is the only
philosophy that can really unite, on the basis of the one common Self in all, a Hindu and a
Mohammedan, Catholic and a Protestant, a Vaishnavite and a Saivite, an Irishman and an
Englishman, a European and an American, on a common platform, and in the core of their hearts
also. It is the only philosophy that, when properly understood and practised, can put a definite stop
to the world war, dissensions, splits, communal fights, skirmishes, etc., that exist in different
nations and communities.

Vedanta is a magnetic healing balm for the wounded and afflicted in the dreadful
battle-field of this dire Samsara. It is the divine collyrium which removes the cataract of ignorance
and gives a new inner eye of intuition or wisdom. It is the direct royal road to the domain of
unalloyed felicity and the Supreme Abode of Immortality and Eternal Bliss.

It eradicates ignorance(cid:151)the root-cause of human sufferings(cid:151)puts an end to the
ever-revolving wheel of births and deaths and confers immortality, infinite knowledge and bliss. It
gives hope to the hopeless, power to the powerless, vigour to the vigourless and joy to the joyless.

Vedanta speaks of one Atma or Brahman which is beginningless, endless, timeless,

spaceless, immortal, self-luminous, indivisible and all-pervading, who is Sat-Chit-Ananda.

58

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

Vedanta gives freedom for all. It embraces or includes one and all. Vedanta is neither theory
nor dry philosophy for contention and argumentation. It is actual life of perennial bliss in Brahman
or Truth. Equip yourself with four means. Enquire, (cid:147)Who am I?(cid:148) Meditate on Brahman. Know
(cid:147)Thou art That.(cid:148) O aspirants bold! Say Om Tat Sat; Om-Sat-Chit-Ananda-rupah, Sivoham,
Sivoham; Sat-Chit-Ananda-Svarupoham."

MESSAGE OF GITA

The Atma is not born nor does He ever die. He is unborn, eternal, changeless, ancient and

inexhaustible. He is not killed when the body is killed. He slays not, nor is he slain.

A Sthitaprajna or Jivanmukta is free from desires, longings, fears, mineness, (cid:145)I-ness(cid:146) and
attachment. He is satisfied in his own self. He is indifferent amidst sensual pleasures. He is not
elated by getting desirable objects. He has a poised mind at all times and under all conditions. He is
centred in his own self.

Work incessantly without egoism and without expectation of fruits. Have a balanced mind

in success and failure. You will not be bound by Karmas or actions.

The senses move among sense-objects. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going,
sleeping, breathing, speaking, sneezing, opening and closing the eyes are the functions or Dharmas
of the organs only. In reality thou art the silent witness of the activities of the senses and the
modifications of the mind. Prakriti or Svabhava does everything. The Atma is actionless
(Nishkriya). In essence, thou-art the Atma.

With the mind harmonised in Yoga, he who sees the Self in all beings and all beings in the

Self sees the same everywhere.

He who hates no creature, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free from
attachment and egoism, balanced in pleasure and pain, forgiving, ever-content, steady in
meditation, self-controlled, possessed of firm conviction with mind and intellect dedicated to the
Lord, who neither rejoices nor hates, neither grieves nor desires, who is full of devotion, who is the
same to a foe and a friend in honour and dishonour, who is the same in cold and heat, in pleasure and
pain, who is balanced in censure and praise, is a great devotee or Gunatita. He is very dear to the
Lord.

Doubtless the mind is fleeting like the air, impetuous and restless. It is hard to be controlled.

But by practice (Abhyasa) and dispassion (Vairagya) it can be controlled.

Fix your mind on the Lord. Become His devotee. Sacrifice everything unto the Lord. Bow
down to Him. Surely you will attain Him. Abandon the fruits of all works. Take refuge in the Lord
alone. He will liberate you from all sins.

Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga; wherever is Partha, the archer; there is prosperity,

victory, happiness and sound policy.

ESSENCE OF YOGA

ESSENCE OF YOGA-VASISHTHA

If the four sentinels that wait at the gates of Moksha (salvation), viz., Santi (peace), Vichara
(Atmic enquiry), Santosha (contentment), and Satsanga (association with the wise), are befriended,
then there will be no obstacle in the attainment of the final emancipation. Even if one of them is
befriended, then he will introduce you to the rest of his companions.

If you attain knowledge of the Self or Brahma Jnana, you will be freed from the trammels of
births and deaths. All doubts will vanish; all Karmas will perish. It is through one(cid:146)s own efforts
alone that the immortal, all-blissful Brahmic seat can be attained.

The slayer of Atma is the mind only. The form of the mind is Sankalpas. The true nature of
the mind consists in the Vasanas. The actions of the mind alone are truly termed Karmas or actions.
The universe is nothing but the mind, manifesting as such only through the potency of Brahman.
The mind contemplating on the body becomes the body itself and then enmeshed in it, is afflicted by
it.

The mind manifests itself as the external world in the shape of pains or pleasures. The mind
subjectively is consciousness; objectively it is this universe. The mind attains, through its enemy of
discrimination, the quiescent state of Para-Brahman. The real bliss is that one which arises when the
mind, diverted of all desires through the eternal Jnana, destroys its subtle form. The Sankalpas and
Vasanas (subtle desires), which you generate, enmesh you as in a net. The self-light of
Para-Brahman alone is appearing as the mind or this universe.

Persons without Atmic enquiry will see as real this world which is nothing but of the nature
of Sankalpa. The expansion of this mind alone is Sankalpa. Sankalpa, through its power of
differentiation, generates this universe. Extinction of Sankalpas alone is Moksha.

The enemy of Atma is this impure mind only which is filled with excessive delusion and
hosts of worldly thoughts. There is no other vessel of this earth to wade through the ocean of rebirth
than the mastery of the antagonistic mind.

The original sprout of the painful Ahamkara (egoism) with its tender stem of rebirths at
length ramifies itself everywhere with its long branches of (cid:145)mine(cid:146) and (cid:145)thine(cid:146) and yields its unripe
fruits of death, disease, old age, pains and sorrows. This tree can be destroyed to its root by the fire
of Jnana only.

All the heterogeneous visibles perceived through the organs of sense are only unreal but that

which is real is Para Brahman or the Supreme Soul.

If all objects which have an enchanting appearance become eye-sores and present the very
reverse of the former feelings, then the mind is destroyed. All your properties are useless. All
wealth land you in dangers. Desirelessness will take you to the eternal blissful abode.

60

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

Destroy Vasanas and Sankalpas. Kill egoism. Annihilate this mind. Equip yourself with the
four means. Meditate on the pure, immortal, all-pervading Self or Atma. Get knowledge of the Self
and attain immortality, everlasting peace, eternal bliss, freedom and perfection.

MESSAGE OF WISDOM

The desire to know the Brahman springs only in the person whose mind is pure, who is free
from desires and who is free from the deeds done in this birth and in the previous ones, becomes
disgusted with the external, ephemeral perishable objects.

Even when Brahman is explained, those who have not been purged of their faults and
impurities, either disbelieve or misbelieve it as was the case with Indra, Virochana, etc. Therefore,
knowledge as inculcated arises only in him who has, by Tapas, etc., performed either in this birth or
in many previous births purified himself. The Sruti says: (cid:147)To that high-souled man whose devotion
to the Lord is great and whose devotion to his preceptor is as great as that to the Lord, these secrets
explained become illuminated.(cid:148)

Just as the coloured water penetrates freely and nicely a piece of cloth when it is pure white,
so also, the instructions of a sage can penetrate and settle down in the hearts of aspirants only when
their minds are calm, when there are no desires for enjoyments and when the impurities of their
minds are destroyed.

(cid:147)But I assure you, on the authority of my own intuitional knowledge as well as that of other
illumined souls, that the Reality can be realised by man. But one who has known it cannot
communicate it to others for want of means.(cid:148)

(cid:151)Sage Vasishtha.

Even the knowledge acquired by the five senses which are common to all cannot be
communicated to others. You cannot tell the taste of butter to a man who has never tasted it or even
communicate the idea of colour to one born blind.

All that a teacher can do is to tell his disciple the method of knowing the Truth or the path

that leads to the disclosure of intuitional faculty.

Hold the magnificent torch of faith. Fly high the unique banner of peace. Wear the
magnificent shield of dispassion. Put on the marvellous coat-of-arms of discrimination. Sing the
immortal song of (cid:145)Soham(cid:146). March boldly with the banner of Pranava(cid:151)Om Om Om. Blow the
wonderful conch of courage. Kill the enemies(cid:151)doubt, ignorance, passion and egoism(cid:151)and enter
the illimitable kingdom of Atma. Possess the imperishable wealth of Atma. Taste the divine
immortal essence. Drink the nectar of Immortality.

61

ESSENCE OF YOGA

MESSAGE OF PEACE

The kingdom of peace is beyond all speech and thought. Peace is not merely the absence of
noise, tumult, strife or quarrels, controversies or disputes. It is not a condition or environment from
which all undesirable elements are removed. This peace is not an inert passive state. It is not a
hypnotic trance. It is not a negative physical condition. It is a positive state of spiritual attainment. It
is your centre, ideal and goal. It is perfect awareness. It is a magnificent, indescribable state in
which the pure soul enjoys the highest divine bliss and transcendental divine knowledge. You will
become absolutely fearless and desireless by drinking this divine nectar of peace. You will be in
communion with the Supreme Soul or Atma by attaining this peace. In this state of peace there are
no yesterdays or tomorrows, no sunset or daybreak(cid:151)there is eternal sunshine. It can hardly be
acquired from external sources. It can be reached only by patient spiritual practices.

You may be in quite adverse circumstances. You may remain in the midst of calamities,
troubles, tribulations, difficulties and sorrows, and yet, you may enjoy the inward harmony and
peace if you rest in God by withdrawing the senses, by stilling the mind and eradicating its
impurities. Lord Jesus was persecuted in a variety of ways. He was put to death on the cross and yet
what did he say? He said, (cid:147)O Lord, forgive them! They know not what they are doing.(cid:148) How
peaceful He was even when His life was at stake! He was enjoying the inner peace.

The goal of life is attainment of self-realisation or God-consciousness. There is one
supreme, undying, intelligent principle or essence or Atma or the Supreme Self who dwells in the
chambers of your heart. He exists in the past, present and future. He is Existence Absolute,
Knowledge Absolute and Bliss Absolute. The ignorant may vainly search for their happiness in
perishable external objects that are conditioned in time, space and causation. He has no peace of
mind. His desires are not gratified. He amasses wealth, begets children, gets titles, honours, name
and fame and yet his mind is restless. He has no abiding joy and lasting happiness. He is still in want
of something. He has no feeling of fulness. This feeling of fulness and eternal satisfaction can only
be obtained by realising one(cid:146)s own Self through self-restraint, purity and meditation.

How long do you want

to lead a life of duality, restlessness, discontentment and
dissatisfaction? How long do you wish to lead a life of ignorance, bitterness, hatred and separation?
How long do you wish to continue your selfish struggles? How long do you wish to behold
differences and distinctions? How long do you wish to keep the barrier between man and man?

You cry for peace or Santi. But where to get it and through whom? You can realise peace in
your own heart through association with the sages and by meditation. You can find this peace only
in stillness. Peace can be found only within. You certainly cannot find it in external objects. Look
within. Sit silently in a quiet room for one or two hours. Close your eyes. Concentrate on a point
between the two eyebrows. Withdraw the senses and the mind from the external objects. Be still.
Silence the surging emotions and bubbling thoughts. Forget the body and the world. Enter into the
great calm. Get deep down into the innermost recesses of your heart. Plunge in the ocean of peace.
Realise your oneness with the one Supreme Self that dwells in the chambers of your heart. Have

62

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

four daily sittings in winter and two in summer. Be regular in your practice. Regularity is of
paramount importance.

It is useless to talk of the cessation of war while you are all full of petty jealousy and private
hatred. Remove your discordant, inharmonious vibrations first. There will be no more war between
nations. Individuals only go to constitute a nation. Lead an ideal life of peace. Ruthlessly kill
suspicion, prejudice of all sorts, envy, selfishness, greed for power and possessions. Lead a simple
life. Practise daily meditation and establish peace in your own heart. Then radiate it to your
neighbours and all who come in contact with you. Disseminate it far and wide.

Mysterious is this peace. If you yourself enjoy this peace, you can contribute peace to the
world. Realise this Peace that passeth all understanding and be free. May this Peace guide you all!
May this Peace be your centre, ideal and goal!

PHILOSOPHY AND MEDITATION ON (cid:145)OM(cid:146)

Brahman or the Supreme Being is the highest of all. Om is His name. So, Om is to be adored.
Om is everything. Om is the symbol of Brahman. It is the word of power. It is the sacred
monosyllable. It is the essence of the Vedas. It is the boat to take you to the other chore of
fearlessness and immortality.

Pranava or Om is the greatest of all Mantras. It bestows liberation directly. All Mantras
begin with Om. Every hymn begins with Om. Every Upanishad begins with Om. Gayatri begins
with Om. The oblations that are offered to the various gods are preceded by the chanting of Om. The
greatness of Om cannot be adequately described by anybody.

That place where all speech stops, all thoughts cease, where the function of the intellect and
all organs stop, is Om. The goal or word which all Vedas praise, which all scriptures proclaim and
wishing for which the aspirants lead the life of Brahmacharya is Om. Om is verily the highest. It is
the best support. It is the highest Truth. He who knows Om is worshipped in the world of Brahman.
He obtains verily whatever he desires.

Om is formed by adoring the letters A, U and M. (cid:145)A(cid:146) represents the beginning of the range of
sound. (cid:145)U(cid:146) represents the middle. (cid:145)M(cid:146) represents the end. Thus Om covers the whole range of sound
and words.

All triplets, such as, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva; Virat, Hiranyagarbha, Ishvara; Sattva, Rajas,
Tamas; waking state, dream state, deep sleep state; creation, preservation and destruction, etc., are
represented by Om.

Chanting of Om, Japa or silent repetition of Om, singing of Om, meditation on Om, purify
the mind, remove the tossing of the mind, destroy the evil of ignorance and help the aspirant to
merge in Brahman or the Supreme Self.

63

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Om is the bow, mind is the arrow, Brahman or the Supreme Self is its aim. Hit at Brahman
with a pure and one-pointed mind. Just as the arrow becomes one with the target, you will become
one with Brahman.

Know this one syllable only. You will know everything. You will attain the highest

knowledge.

Sit in Padma, Siddha or any comfortable pose. Concentrate on the spot midway between the
two eyebrows (Trikuta). Meditate on the significance of the following formulae with Bhava or
feeling. Repeat them mentally also.

SAT-CHIT-ANANDA-SVARUPOHAM

I am Sat-Chit-Ananda Svarupa
Aham Brahmasmi(cid:151)I am Brahman
I am All-pervading consciousness
I am Sakshi (silent witness)
Soham, Sivoham: I am He, I am Siva
I am distinct from body and mind
I am Immortal. All-pervading Soul

Om Om Om
Om Om Om
Om Om Om
Om Om Om
Om Om Om
Om Om Om
Om Om Om

You will soon realise your identity with the Supreme Self and shine in your pristine

Brahmic glory.

JIVANMUKTA

A Jivanmukta or liberated sage is absolutely free from desires, fear, selfishness, egoism,

mineness, attachment, greed and hatred. He is full of pure love, compassion and mercy.

He has mastery over the mind and senses. He does not identify himself with the body. He

always dwells in his own Inner Self. He is ever contented and happy.

He does not offend anybody in thought, word and deed. He is not hurt even a bit by taunts,
censures, insults and persecutions. He keeps equanimity of mind in censure and praise, honour and
dishonour, pleasure and pain.

He lives in the world but he is not of the world. He has no idea of enjoyment or enjoyer. This

state is indescribable. He is Brahman himself.

He is a power-house of spiritual energy. Sit before him. Your doubts will be cleared by
themselves. You will feel a peculiar thrill of joy and peace in his presence. He may not speak and
yet may teach the aspirants through the language of silence.

He sleeps wherever he likes and eats anything from anybody(cid:146)s hands. He is above
injunctions and prohibitions but he will not violate the rules of the scriptures. He is above good and
evil, virtue and vice. He finds no faults with others. He never becomes angry even under extreme

64

PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA

provocations. He is ever gentle and mild. He always speaks sweetly. He never utters harsh words.
He has no dislike or hatred for any creature in this world in thought, word or deed. He blesses those
who persecute him.

He speaks a few words but these words produce a tremendous impression on the minds of

the hearers. They give a new life and joy to all who hear his message.

The liberated sage (the prince of ascetics) has conquered the enemy of ignorance. He has
known the secret of true bliss. He has reached the imperishable seat of Brahman. He always rests in
his own Sat-Chit-Ananda-Svarupa.

He has realised that he is distinct from the three bodies and five sheaths and that he is the

witness of the three states. He is free from the distinctions of I, he and you.

A Jivanmukta inspired with the divine spirit, intoxicated with the immortal nectar, filled
with the infinite Atma, endowed with an equal vision and balanced mind, beholds only the Self or
Atma everywhere and embraces all with pure love. Glory to such awakened inspired high souls!
May their blessings be upon you forever!

DIALOGUES FROM SCRIPTURES

RAMA-VASISHTHA-SAMVADA

(Yoga-Vasishtha)

Sri Rama asked: (cid:147)Venerable Guru! What is attraction? What is non-attraction? What is that
attraction which leads one to bondage? What is that non-attraction which tends to freedom? How
can I destroy this bondage? Please enlighten me on the above points.(cid:148)

Vasishtha replied: (cid:147)If any one believes that this body is permanent, if he fails to discriminate
between the body and its presider or indweller or inner ruler who is eternal and if he thinks always
of body only he is a slave to attraction and he is bound by attraction. This is attraction. This will
undoubtedly lead to bondage. The belief that everything is Brahman or Atma only, and that there is
nothing for one to love or hate in this universe is non-attraction. This non-attraction will lead to
Moksha or final emancipation.

Jivanmuktas are endowed with non-attraction. When there is non-attraction, the mind
abandons the pleasures of the world, egoism vanishes and attachment for everything perishes. The
state of non-attraction leads to Moksha. Those who have attained the state of non-attraction
relinquish the fruits of actions. They seek neither action nor inaction. Attraction entails one in
rebirths.

65

ESSENCE OF YOGA

This attraction is of two kinds, viz., Bandhya (binding) and Abandhya (non-binding). The
former belongs to the ignorant, while the latter is the ornament of those who have attained
self-realisation. The former produces rebirths through attachment to objects while the latter
generates discrimination and knowledge of the Self. Lord Vishnu and the hosts of Siddhas protect
this earth by performing various actions through the Abandhya attraction.

A Jivanmukta is not attached to actions though he performs manifold actions for the
well-being of the world. He is quite indifferent though he associates himself with objects. He has no
attraction for the objects. His mind is ever fixed in the Supreme Self only. He regards this world as
an unreality. He does neither live in future expectation nor does he rely on his present possession.
He does not live on the pleasure of his past memory. Sleeping, he is awake in his vision of supreme
light; and waking, he is plunged in the deep, sleepless sleep of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He does actions
and remains as if he has done nothing. He does all actions without the error of believing himself as
the actor. He neither rejoices nor grieves at anything. He behaves himself as a boy with boys and as
a veteran with old people. He is youthful in the society of young men and is grave in the company of
the wise. He rejoices at the happiness of others. He is sympathetic with the people who are in
distress. O Ram! Conduct yourself in such a manner when you rule your kingdom. You will never
lose sight of the Reality."

DEVA-YAKSHA-SAMVADA

(Kena Upanishad)

In the fight with the Asuras, the Devas were victorious. The Devas thought that they did so
with their own power and prowess and forgot that it was divine help which brought victory to them.
Lord Brahma wanted to teach them a lesson. He knew their idea of being puffed up with vanity and
appeared before them in the form of a Yaksha (Great spirit) the beginning and end of which were
not visible. They did not know Him. They spoke to Agni thus: (cid:147)O Jataveda! Find out what this great
spirit is(cid:148). He said (cid:147)Yes(cid:148). Agni ran up to Brahma and Brahma said: (cid:147)Who art thou(cid:148)? He replied: (cid:147)I
am verily Agni, I am verily Jatavedas(cid:148). Brahma asked Agni: (cid:147)What power hast thou?(cid:148) Agni
replied: (cid:147)I can even burn whatsoever there is on the earth(cid:148). Brahma placed a blade of grass before
Agni and said: (cid:145)Burn this(cid:146). Agni approached it with all its power. He could not burn it. Next came
Vayu (the god of wind). Brahma asked Vayu: (cid:147)What power hast thou?(cid:148) Vayu replied: (cid:147)I can blow
away all the universe and all that is on the earth(cid:148). Brahma placed a blade of grass before Vayu and
said: (cid:147)Blow this away(cid:148). Vayu approached it with all his power and was not able to make it move an
inch from its place. Last of all the chief of the Devas, Indra himself came. But when he reached the
spot he found that the Yaksha had vanished. Indra was in a state of great dilemma. He was confused
and perplexed. When he was thus standing there, bewildered and ashamed at their defeat, Uma
(Haimavati)(cid:151)the daughter of Himavan (Himalayas) and the consort of Lord Siva(cid:151)appeared
before him and revealed to him the real identity of the Yaksha. Then only Indra knew the (cid:145)spirit(cid:146) to
be Brahma. He verily became excellent before the other gods on account of the grace of the Mother
Uma.

On account of egoism, you think that you do everything and so you are bound. Feel that you
are an instrument in the hands of God. God works through your hands, beholds through your eyes,
hears through your ears, smells through your nose. You will be freed from egoism and the bondage

of Karma. You will attain peace and become one with God. This is the secret of Karma Yoga and
Bhakti Yoga.

YAJNAVALKYA-MAITREYI-SAMVADA

Yajnavalkya, the greatest seer and sage, said: (cid:147)Maitreyi, verily, I am going away from this
house into the forest to enter another order of life (Sannyasa); therefore let me divide my property
between you and Katyayani(cid:148).

Maitreyi said: (cid:147)My venerable lord, if this whole world with all its wealth belongs to me, tell

me truly, could I attain immortality(cid:148).

(cid:147)No,(cid:148) replied Yajnavalkya, (cid:147)Like the life of rich people will be your life; but there is no

hope of obtaining immortality by wealth(cid:148).

Maitreyi: (cid:147)Of what use would be wealth to me, if I do not become thereby immortal? Tell

me, O venerable lord, any means of attaining immortality of which thou knowest(cid:148).

Yajnavalkya replied: (cid:147)Come, sit down, my beloved Maitreyi, I will explain it to thee. Try to

understand well what I say(cid:148).

Yajnavalkya said: (cid:147)Verily, not indeed for the husband(cid:146)s sake the husband is dear, but for the
sake Of the Self the husband is dear. Verily, not indeed for the wife(cid:146)s sake the wife is dear, but for
the sake of the Self the wife is dear. Verily, not indeed for the sake of the son the son is dear, but for
the sake of the Self the son is dear. Verily, this immortal all-pervading Atman or Brahman is to be
seen, heard, reflected and meditated upon, O Maitreyi: Atma Vaare Drashtavyah Srotavyo
Mantayo Nididhyasitavyah(cid:148).

O Maitreyi! When there is duality, one sees the other, one smells the other, one tastes the
other, one salutes the other, one speaks to the other, one touches the other, one knows the other, but
when the Self or Atma only is all this, how could one see the other, how could he smell the other,
touch the other, know the other? How could he know Him by whom he knows all this? That Self is
to be described by (cid:147)No, no(cid:148) (Neti, Neti). Atma nor the Supreme Self is imperishable. He is free and
unattached. He is not subject to pain or destruction. How could one know the knower? Thus, O
beloved Maitreyi, thou hast been instructed".

Having said this, Yajnavalkya went to the forest.

NACHIKETO-YAMA-SAMVADA

(Katha Upanishad)

Nachiketas said: (cid:147)That which thou seest as other than virtue and vice, other than cause and

effect, other than the past and future, tell me that, O Lord Yama. This is my third boon from thee(cid:148).

67

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Yama replied: (cid:147)The goal which all the Vedas speak of, which all penances proclaim and
wishing for which the aspirants lead the life of a Brahmacharin or celibate, that goal I will briefly
tell thee. It is Om(cid:148).

This word is verily Brahman; this word is verily the highest; he who knows this word,

obtains, verily whatever he wishes(cid:151)he attains Immortality and Eternal Bliss.

This Atman is beginningless, endless, birthless, deathless, changeless,

formless,
attributeless, and colourless. He is without sound, touch, smell and taste. He is eternal, immortal,
all-pervading, self-luminous, indivisible, one without a second. He is beyond, Avyaktam or the
unmanifested. He dwells in the intellect or the cave of the heart. He is the inner Self of all beings.

He who is free from desires, whose mind is concentrated and peaceful, whose senses are
subdued, beholds this mysterious Atman through meditation and intuition in his own intellect and
enjoys immortality and everlasting peace and bliss.

This Atman is hidden in all beings. It is realised by subtle seers through their sharp and

subtle intellect, with eyes and other senses turned from sensual objects.

When all desires are destroyed, when the three knots of the heart, i.e., Avidya (ignorance),
Kama (desire), Karma (work) are rent asunder, when, the five organs of knowledge are at rest
together with the mind and when the intellect ceases functioning or becomes calm, you will attain
immortality or Parama Gati or the highest state.

Just as you draw the pith or stalk from a reed, so also, you will have to draw or take out this
essence of Atma from the body or the five sheaths patiently and boldly through meditation, Vichara
or enquiry and Viveka (discrimination)".

Nachiketas got clear instructions on Brahma Vidya from Lord Yama through the third boon
granted by Yama, practised meditation and attained Brahman, i.e., became immortal through
knowledge of the Self. Any qualified student like Nachiketas who knows the Atman can surely
attain immortality.

(cid:147)Om Saha navavatu, Saha nau bhunaktu,
Saha viryam Karavavahai(cid:146); Tejasvi navadhitamastu,
Ma vidvishavahai."
Om Santih! Santih! Santih!

(cid:147)Om! May He protect us both (teacher and pupil). May He cause us both to enjoy the bliss of
Mukti. May we both exert together to find out the true meaning of the scriptures. May our studies be
fruitful. May we never quarrel with each other(cid:148).

Om Peace ! Peace ! Peace !

KAUSALYA-PIPPALADA-SAMVADA

(Prasna Upanishad)

Kausalya, son of Asvala, questioned Pippalada: (cid:147)O Bhagavan Pippalada: Whence is this
Prana born? How does it come into this body? How does it abide after it has divided itself? How
does it go out? How does it support what is without? How does it support all within the body?(cid:148)

He replied: (cid:147)You ask questions about transcendental matters. I will explain to thee because

you are a great enquirer of Brahman.

This Prana is born of the Atman. As is this shadow in the man, so is this Prana in the Atman.

By the action of the mind this enters into this body.

As a king commands his officers, saying to them: (cid:145)Govern these or those villages(cid:146), so does

this Prana dispose the other Pranas, each for their separate allotted work.

The Apana dwells in the organs of excretion and generation: the Prana itself abides in the
eye, ear, mouth and nose. In the middle is Samana. It distributes the food supplied equally and the
seven flames proceed from it.

This Atman is in the heart. Here there are a hundred and one nerves (arteries). Each of them
has a hundred branches; again every one of these has seventy-two thousand sub-branches. In these
the Vyana moves.

Again, through one other, the Udana ascending, leads us upwards to the virtuous world by

good work; to sinful worlds by sin: and to the world of men by virtue and sin combined.

The sun verily is the external Prana. He rises and assists the Prana in the eye. The goddess of
the earth attracts Apana downwards. The other (between the sun and the earth) is Samana. The wind
is Vyana.

The external fire indeed is Udana. Therefore, he whose fire has gone out, enters another

body with his senses absorbed in the mind.

Whatever his thought (at the time of death), with that he attains Prana: and the Prana united
with Udana together with the Jivatma, leads on to the world thought of. The learned man who
knows Prana thus(cid:151)his offspring does not perish and he becomes immortal.

He who knows the origin, the entry, the seat, the fivefold distribution of Prana and its

internal state in the body, obtains immortality, yea, obtains immortality".

UDDALAKA-SVETAKETU-SAMVADA

(Chhandogya Upanishad)

Uddalaka said: (cid:147)Svetaketu! Have you ever asked your teacher for that instruction by which
we hear what cannot be heard, by which we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know
what cannot be known?(cid:148)

Svetaketu said: (cid:147)What is that instruction, Sir?(cid:148)

The father replied, (cid:147)My dear, just as by a single lump of clay, all that is made of clay is
known, all modifications being only a name based upon words, (the difference being only a name
arising from speech) but the truth being that all is clay(cid:151)thus, my dear, is that instruction(cid:148).

(cid:147)Please Sir, explain to me further(cid:148) said Svetaketu.

Uddalaka: (cid:147)Bring me a fruit of that Nyagrodha tree (banyan tree)(cid:148).

(cid:147)Now, that which is the subtle essence (the root of all) in That all that exists has its Self; that

ESSENCE OF YOGA

Gargi said: (cid:147)In what is the ether woven and rewoven like the warp and the woof?(cid:148)

Yajnavalkya replied: (cid:147)O Gargi, in Brahman is the ether woven and rewoven like the warp
and the woof. Sages call this the Akshara (the imperishable). It is neither coarse, nor subtle, neither
short nor long, neither red nor white. It is neither shadow nor darkness. It is without ears, eyes, or
mind, or breath, without speech, without smell, without mouth. It has no within and no without.(cid:148)

(cid:147)By the command of this Indestructible Being, O Gargi, sun and moon, heaven and earth,
stand upheld in their places. By the command of this Akshara, O Gargi, minutes, hours, days,
nights, weeks, months, seasons and years stand apart.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Whosoever, O Gargi, without knowing the Akshara, departs from this world, becomes a
miser. But he, O Gargi, who departs from this world, knowing this Indestructible Being, is a true
Brahman or liberated sage.(cid:148)

(cid:147)That Brahman, O Gargi, although unseen, but He sees; although unheard, but He hears;
although unthought, but He thinks; although unknown, but He knows. There is none that sees but
He, there is none that hears but He, there is none that thinks but He, there is none that knows but He.
In that Akshara, then, O Gargi, the ether is woven and rewoven like the warp and the woof.(cid:148)

On hearing these words of wisdom from the mouth of Yajnavalkya, Gargi became silent.

PRAJAPATI-INDRA-SAMVADA

Prajapati said: (cid:147)One must search out and must try to understand the Self or Atman which is
free from sin, old age, death, grief, hunger and thirst, with true desires (Sat-Kama), and true will
(Sat-Sankalpa). Then only he will obtain eternal bliss and immortality.(cid:148)

Indra said: (cid:147)O Venerable Lord! I want to know the Atman. Please instruct me.(cid:148)

Prajapati said: (cid:147)Adorn yourself well; dress yourself well; clean yourself well and then look

He replied: (cid:147)I behold myself in the basin of water well-adorned, well-dressed and clean.(cid:148)

Prajapati said: (cid:147)That is the Self, the Immortal, the Fearless(cid:151)that is Brahman.(cid:148)

Indra was not satisfied with this instruction. He reflected within himself: (cid:147)The Atman also
will be blind, if the body is blind; lame, if the body is lame; one-eyed, if the body is one-eyed;

crippled, if the body is crippled; and will perish if the body perishes. Therefore I see no good in this
doctrine.(cid:148)

He again went to Prajapati.

Prajapati Said: (cid:147)The Self that dreams is the Immortal, Fearless, Brahman.(cid:148)

Indra was not satisfied with this doctrine also. He reflected: (cid:147)Though the dream self is not
blind when the body is blind, not one-eyed when the body is one-eyed, is not destroyed when the
body is destroyed yet it becomes conscious of pain and sheds tears even in dream. Therefore I see
no good in this(cid:148).

Indra again went to Prajapati.

Prajapati said: (cid:147)The Self that enjoys deep sleep is the Immortal, Fearless, Brahman.(cid:148)

Indra reflected: (cid:147)In deep sleep there is utter annihilation. I do not get any intuitional

knowledge, I see no good in this doctrine also.(cid:148)

Indra again went to Prajapati.

Prajapati said: (cid:147)O Indra, this body is mortal. The embodied self is subject to pleasure and
pain. The eye is the instrument of seeing. The nose is the instrument of smelling. The ear is the
instrument of hearing. But the Atman or Brahman is the silent witness (Sakshi). He is immortal,
fearless. He is distinct from the three bodies, the three Avasthas or states of consciousness the mind,
body and senses.(cid:148)

Behind this world-show, behind these physical phenomena, behind these names and forms,
behind the feelings, thoughts, emotions and sentiments there dwells the silent witness thy immortal
friend and real well-wisher(cid:151)the Purusha or world teacher, the unseen governor or master, the
unknown Yogi, the indivisible power of consciousness or hidden sage. That is the only permanent
reality and living truth. That is Brahman or the Supreme Being or the Absolute. That is Atma. That
is Self. The goal of human life is to realise the reality behind the changing phenomena. The
summum bonum of human aspiration is to attain Self-realisation. Self-realisation alone can make
you absolutely free and independent. Trust not your body, mind and senses. Have inner spiritual
life. Attain knowledge of the Self through steady devotion and discipline. Drink the nectar of
immortality, quench the flames of Samsara and allay its tortures, miseries and sorrows.

Friends! Is there not a higher mission in life besides eating, sleeping and talking? Is there not
any higher form of eternal bliss than these transitory and illusory pleasures? Is there not a dignified
life than the sensual life? How uncertain is life here! How insecure is our existence in this
earth-plane with various kinds of fear! How painful is this mundane life? Should we not attempt
diligently now to reach a place(cid:151)the immortal abode, our original sweet home of pristine purity and
divine splendour(cid:151)where there is eternal sunshine, absolute security, perfect peace and where there
is neither disease, nor death, nor war?

Come, come! Become a Yogi. Come out of your narrow holes or ruts. Crush all sorts of
superstitions. Aim high. To become an advocate, or a doctor, or an engineer, or a professor, is the
height of your ambition. Can this give you freedom? Can this give you eternal bliss? Can this give
you everlasting peace? Can this make you immortal? Do you not like to attain perfection or
immortality? Do you not wish to achieve the summum bonum of existence(cid:151)Kaivalya or
independence(cid:151)Atma Svarajya? Then come, struggle for higher things. Be bold! Look not back.
March forward! Enquire: (cid:147)Who am I?(cid:148) Hear, reflect, meditate and realise the Atmic splendour!

Time rolls on. New becomes old and old becomes new again. Today is the most auspicious
New Year(cid:146)s day. God has given you another chance this year to enable you to strive for your
salvation. Today man is. Tomorrow he is not. Therefore avail yourself of this golden opportunity,

On this glorious New Year(cid:146)s day make a strong resolve to wipe away all the old worldly

Vasanas or tendencies and bad impressions and to control the senses and the mind.

Know the value of time. Time is most precious. Utilise every second profitably. Live every
moment of your life for the realisation of your ideal and goal. Do not procrastinate. That
(cid:147)tomorrow(cid:148) will never come. Now or never. Abandon idle gossiping. Kill egoism, laziness and
inertia. Forget the past. A glorious and brilliant future is awaiting you.

Equal vision is the touchstone of knowledge. Unselfishness is the touchstone of virtue.
Brahmacharya is the touchstone of ethics. Oneness is the touchstone of Self-realisation. Humility is
the touchstone of devotion. Therefore, be unselfish, humble and pure. Develop equal vision. Be in
tune with the Infinite.

Satyam (truth) is the seed. Ahimsa is the root. Meditation is the shower. Santi (peace) is the
flower. Moksha (salvation) is the fruit. Therefore, speak the truth, practise Ahimsa and meditation.
Cultivate Santi. You will attain the final emancipation or freedom from the trammels of births and
deaths, and enjoy Eternal bliss.

Be thou a spiritual warrior of Truth. Put on the armour of discrimination. Wear the shield of
dispassion. Hold the flag of Dharma. Sing the song of Soham or Sivoham. March boldly with the

Guru Purnima is a very auspicious day for doing vigorous Sadhana or Yogic practice and
for starting any spiritual Sadhana also. This is the Ashadha Purnima day. This is also known by the
name Vyasa Puja day. Sri Vyasa and the Brahma Vidya Gurus are worshipped on this day.

On this memorable day, Sri Vyasa, one of the Chiranjeevis, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu,

DUSSERA MESSAGE

Salutations to Sri Durga (Mother Divine) Who exists in all beings in the form of
intelligence, mercy, beauty; Who is the consort of Lord Siva; who creates, sustains and destroys the
universe.

76

MESSAGES

Dussera is the greatest Hindu festival of adoring God as Mother. Durga represents the
Divine Mother. She is the energy aspect of the Lord. Without Durga, Siva has no expression and
without Siva, Durga has no existence. Siva is the soul of Durga. Durga is identical with Siva. Lord
Siva is only the silent witness. He is motionless, absolutely changeless. He is not affected by the
cosmic play. Durga does everything.

Mother-worship is the worship of God as the Divine Mother(cid:151)Sri Mata. Sakti is the power
of the Lord or the cosmic energy. The Divine Mother in Her aspect of Durga is represented as
having ten different weapons in her hands. She is sitting on a lion. She keeps up the Lila of the Lord
through the three Gunas(cid:151)Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Vidya, Santi, lust, anger, greed, egoism and
pride are all Her forms.

The Upasana or worship of Devi or Universal Mother leads to the attainment of knowledge
of the Self. The story of the Kena Upanishad known as the (cid:147)Yaksha Prasna(cid:148) supports this view.
Uma taught the Truth to the Devas. Goddess Sakti sheds wisdom on Her devotees.

A child is more familiar with the mother than with the father, because she is very kind,
loving, tender, affectionate and looks after the wants of the child. In the spiritual field also the
aspirant or the devotee(cid:151)the spiritual child(cid:151)has intimate relationship with the Mother Durga than
with the Father Siva. It behoves, therefore, that the aspirant should approach the Mother first and
She will introduce Her spiritual child to the Father for his illumination or Self-realisation.

Mother(cid:146)s grace is boundless. Her mercy is illimitable. Her knowledge is infinite. Her power
is immeasurable. Her glory is ineffable. Her splendour is indescribable. She gives you Bhukti or
material prosperity and Mukti (liberation) also.

Approach Her with an open heart. Lay bare your heart to Her with frankness and humility.
Be as simple as a child. Kill ruthlessly egoism, cunningness, selfishness and crookedness. Make
total, unreserved, ungrudging surrender to Her. Sing Her praise. Repeat Her name. Worship Her
with faith and unflinching devotion. Do special Puja on Navaratri days. Navaratri or Dussera is the
most suitable occasion for doing intense Sadhana. These nine days are very sacred to Devi. Plunge
yourself in Her worship. Do Anushthana. Devi fought with Bhandasura and his forces for nine days
and nine nights. The war ended in the evening of the tenth day known as Vijaya Dasami day or the
day of victory. Aspirants are initiated on this day. Akshara Abhyasa for children is done on Vijaya
Dasami day. The beginning of learning of any science is done on this most auspicious day. It was on
this day that Arjuna worshipped the Devi before starting the fight against the Kauravas on the field
of Kurukshetra.

May Durga give the milk of divine wisdom to Her children and lift them to the magnificent

heights of divine splendour and glory, the imperishable state of Kaivalya and eternal Sunshine!

DEEPAVALI MESSAGE

Deepavali is the festival of lamps. It is observed almost throughout India with great pomp
and show. It is a time of great rejoicing and worshipping among the Hindus and lasts for two days.
This is held at the beginning of the Hindu commercial year in honour of the Goddess Lakshmi.

77

ESSENCE OF YOGA

It commemorates that blessed day when Sri Rama returned to Ayodhya after killing

Ravana. On this day Sri Krishna killed the demon Narakasura.

In South India all take oil-bath in the morning and wear new clothes. At this festival, Hindu
merchants in North India begin their new account books and pray for success and prosperity during
the coming year. The houses of the Hindus are cleaned and decorated by day and illuminated by
night with earthen lamps. The best and finest illuminations are to be seen in Bombay and Amritsar.
The famous Golden Temple at Amritsar is lit in the evening with thousands of lamps which are
placed all over the steps on the sides of the big tank. Vaishnavites celebrate Govardhana Puja and
feed the people on a large scale Annakoot or Samashti Bhandara).

O Ram! The Light of lights, the self-luminous inner light of Atman is ever burning steadily
in the chambers of your heart. Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Withdraw the senses. Fix the mind on
this supreme light (Param Jyoti) and enjoy the real Deepavali, by attaining illumination of the soul.

Egoism or Ahamkara is the real Narakasura. Kill this egoism through the sword of
Atma-Jnana or knowledge of the Self, merge in Sri Krishna, the supreme light of the world, and
enjoy the spiritual Deepavali of inner illumination.

He who Himself sees all, whom no one beholds, who illumines the intellect, the sun, moon
and stars and the whole universe, but whom they cannot illumine(cid:151)That is Brahman. That is Atma.
Celebrate the real Deepavali by living in Brahman and enjoy the eternal bliss of the soul.

The sun does not shine there, nor do the moon and the stars, nor do these lightnings shine
and much less this fire. All the lights of the world cannot be compared even to a ray of the inner light
of the soul. Merge yourself in this Light of lights and enjoy the supreme Deepavali.

Many Deepavali festivals have come and gone. Yet the hearts of the vast majority of
persons are as dark as the new-moon night. The house is lit with the lamps but the heart is full of
darkness of ignorance. O man! Wake up from the slumber of ignorance. Realise the constant and
eternal light of the soul which has neither rising nor setting through meditation and Vichara or
enquiry and dispel the darkness of ignorance.

May you all attain full inner illumination! May the Supreme Light of lights enlighten your
understanding! May you all get the inexhaustible spiritual wealth of Atma! May you all prosper
gloriously in the material and spiritual planes?

ADVICE TO STUDENTS

Om! Friends, you are the future hope of the motherland. You are the citizens of tomorrow.
You should always think over the goal of life and live to attain it. The goal of life is the attainment of
freedom from all sorts of misery or the state of Kaivalya or liberation from the cycle of births and
deaths. Lead a well-regulated moral life. Moral strength is the backbone of spiritual progress.
Ethical culture is part and parcel of spiritual Sadhana. Keep up Brahmacharya or the vow of
celibacy. By the observance of Brahmacharya many of the sages of yore have attained immortality.
Brahmacharya is the source of new strength, vigour, vitality and success in life, and eternal

78

MESSAGES

happiness hereafter. Loss of this vital energy is the cause of disease, miseries and premature death.
Therefore, take particular care to preserve this vital energy. Practice of Brahmacharya gives good
health, inner strength, peace of mind and long life. It invigorates the mind and the nerves and helps
to conserve physical and mental energy. It augments the strength and courage. It gives power to
face the difficulties in the daily battle of life. A perfect Brahmachari can, like Jnanadeva, move the
world, can command nature and the five elements. Develop faith in the Vedas and the power of
Mantra. Practise meditation daily. Take Sattvic food. Do not overload the stomach. Repent for your
mistakes. Admit your faults freely. Never try to hide your faults by lame excuses or by uttering
falsehoods. Obey the laws of nature. Take plenty of physical exercise daily. Perform the prescribed
duties at the appointed time. Develop simple living and high thinking. Give up vile imitation. Get
thorough overhauling of your wrong-Samskaras you have created through bad association. Study
the Upanishads, the Yoga-Vasishtha, the Brahma Sutras and Sri Sankara(cid:146)s Select Works and other
scriptures. Therein you will find real solace and peace. Some Western philosophers have declared:
(cid:147)We are Christians by birth and faith but we can find the peace which the mind wants and the
satisfaction the soul needs only in the Upanishads of the seers of East.(cid:148) Move amicably with all.
Love all. Serve all. Develop adaptability and the spirit of selfless service and penetrate into the
hearts of all through untiring service. This is verily Advaitic realisation of unity or oneness.

MESSAGE OF FREEDOM

Om, Children of immortality! The Lord is within you. He is seated in the hearts of all
beings. Whatever you see, hear, touch or feel is God. Therefore, hate not anybody, cheat not
anybody, harm not anybody. Love all and be one with all. You will soon attain eternal bliss and
perennial joy. Be self-disciplined. Be simple and harmonious in thought, feeling, diet and dress.
Love all. Fear none. Shake off lethargy, laziness, fear. Lead the Divine Life. Be a seeker after truth
or reality. Understand sorrow and conflict through enquiry and reflection. Move towards freedom,
perfection and eternal bliss every second. Is there any one among you who can say with emphasis
and force: (cid:147)Now I am a deserving aspirant. I am yearning for Moksha. I have equipped myself with
the four means. I have purified my heart through selfless service, Kirtan and Japa. I have served the
Guru with faith and devotion and I have attained his grace and blessings.(cid:148) That man can save the
world. He will soon become a cosmic beacon-light, a unique torch-bearer of wisdom, a dynamic
Yogi. O man! Get yourself ready now. It is a shameful thing that you have lived in vain till now and
spent the life in eating, drinking, sleeping, idle gossiping and worthless pursuits. You have not done
any meritorious act. The hour draws nearer. It is not too late even now. Start Namasmaran, or the
repetition of the Lord(cid:146)s Name from this second. Be sincere and earnest. Love all. You can make
yourself worthy of His Grace. You can cross the formidable ocean of births and deaths and attain
eternal bliss and immortality. Never miss a day in meditation. Regularity is of paramount
importance. When the mind is tired, do not concentrate. Give it a little rest. Do not take heavy food
at night. It will disturb your morning meditation. Japa, Kirtan, Pranayama, Satsanga or association
with sages, practice of Sama (serenity), Dama (self-restraint), Yama (right conduct), Sattvic or pure
food, study of scriptures, meditation, Vichara (Atmic enquiry) all will help you to control the mind
and attain eternal bliss and immortality. If evil thoughts enter your mind, do not use your will-force
to drive them away. You will lose your energy. Om.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q: When I concentrate, so many thoughts arise in my mind. How can I avoid them? Can I suppress
them?
A: Do not try to suppress them with force. The thoughts will manifest with redoubled force. They
will rise up frequently also. You will tax your will and waste your energy. Be a silent witness of

bad dreams.

Q: What are the signs of a person who has no Ahamkara or egoism?
A: He will not identify himself with his body. He will be free from pride, likes, dislikes, jealousy,
anger and hypocrisy.

Q: Why does evil exist in the world?
A: Change the angle of vision or Drishti. All evils will disappear. Evil is negative good. Evil exists
to glorify good. It has a raison d(cid:146)etre, reason for its existence. Evil and good are relative terms.
What is good at one time is evil at another time. What is good for one is evil for another. Understand
this and become wise. Behold the one Atman in all forms and beings. Evil and good are mental
creations. Transmute evil into good by Atma-Drishti. There is good in evil also.

Q: How to lead the life of unity?
A: This is attained by service, charity, sharing what you have with others, cultivating cosmic love
and realising the one Atman seated in the hearts of all, through constant Brahmachintana or
meditation on Atman.

HOW TO LIVE A DIVINE LIFE

1. Nitya Sukha, Parama Santi, eternal satisfaction, Infinite Bliss, knowledge and
Immortality can be had only in God or Atman who gives light to the intellect and the Sun.
Therefore, realise the Sat-Chit-Ananda Atma through meditation right now, this very second, by
purifying the mind.

2. Samsara (world) is Mithya, Asara, Apadramaniya, evanescent, impermanent, full of

miseries, untruth, hatred and selfishness, disease and pain. It is a long dream. Be not worldly.

3. Time is most precious. Utilise every second profitably.

4. Serve Sadhus, Sannyasins, the sick, the poor and the country. This is Pada-Sevan of God.

5. Whenever your friend is annoyed with you, speak to him first, with a smile, and apologise
sincerely with tears in your eyes even though you may be in the right. Serve him nicely with Prema.
Vindictive spirit is a deadly enemy of peace, devotion and Jnana.

6. Observe Mouna (silent) during eating. Observe Mouna for six hours on Sundays.

7. Keep the pictures of Saints and Sages in your bedroom and the front room. Do not keep

any obscene pictures in the house.

8. Speak the truth, preserve Veerya and control anger by Kshama, love and service. Repeat
(cid:145)Om Santih(cid:146) twelve times mentally and drink some cold water when you detect the least symptom
of irritation in your mind.

9. Sleep always alone. Take one meal and some milk at night on Sundays. Do one lakh of

Rama-Nama Japa on Sundays.

10. Write daily for half an hour in a notebook the Mantra of your Ishta Devata or (cid:147)Rama
Rama.(cid:148) Write down in bold types on slips of paper (cid:147)Speak Truth.(cid:148) (cid:147)Om Courage,(cid:148) (cid:147)Om Purity,(cid:148) (cid:147)I

verandah. Keep some slips in your pocket.

11. Keep always a few pies in your pocket and distribute them daily to the poor and the

decrepit.

12. Do Hari-Kirtan at night. Sing (cid:147)Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare(cid:151)Hare
Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare(cid:148) along with the members of your family and
servants of your house for one hour.

13. Study Gita or Upanishads, Ramayana, Bhagavata or Yoga Vasishtha for one hour in the

evening with some of your friends. The ladies of the household should also do this.

EPILOGUE

The beginning of saintliness is killing of egoism or Ahamkara. The end of saintliness is
Eternal Life. The key to saintliness is humility and self-mortification. The light of saintliness is
silent meditation. The garb of saintliness is virtue and tolerance, not the Gerua cloth alone.

Pravritti and Nivritti are not two different paths. They are two aspects of one and the same
path. There is Pravritti in Nivritti and Nivritti in Pravritti. It is the mental state that counts. Look at
Janaka, the king of Videhas. In him, there was absolute Nivritti in Pravritti. Always remember:
(cid:147)Yogasthah Kuru Karmani Sangam Tyaktva Dhananjaya.(cid:148)

Man is the master of his own destiny. He sows an action and reaps a habit; sows a habit and
reaps a character; sows a character and reaps a destiny. So he is entirely responsible for his
Prarabdha Karma. Prarabdha is under his Adheenata or control. He will become an absolute fatalist
and a slothful, inactive man, if he attributes everything to a preordained destiny or Prarabdha. Let
him awaken his free will. Let him avail himself of his Paramartha (Will). God has endowed man
with Buddhi, independent, free thinking principle, rational reasoning and all sorts of faculties. He
can control atoms; he can control elements; he can fly in the air, he can forward a thought from one
corner to another corner of the world; he can command electricity to pump out water from a well; he

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

can walk over water; he can sit on fire: he can pass from one body to another; he can roam about the
world without being seen by any one.

In fact there is nothing impossible for him under the sun. Instead of realising his real nature
by introspection within himself or Atmic enquiry, he dwells in an instinctive plane, wanders about
in vain here and there in this phenomenal world of mere mental creation and forgets the
magnificence of his real Self. He worships man instead of worshipping God. He is a
man-worshipper. He signs (cid:147)I beg to remain. Your obedient servant(cid:148), instead of asserting his divine
nature as a centre of consciousness in the ocean of life, instead of styling as a Director, controller
and supporter of Universe. Wake up immediately to rectify this lamentable condition; otherwise it
will be too late to gather honey in winter! Awake! Arise, Dear Reader!

For sincere spiritual aspirants, marching boldly in the Adhyatmic field, this handy
publication provides, succinctly, innumerable PRACTICAL hints. Every page abounds in much
valuable information in a condensed form. The laconic lessons contained in this book should speak
for themselves. If this proves in any way useful to the ardent Mumukshus, the author(cid:146)s sincere
