SIVANANDA DAY-TO-DAY

To a group of devotees and disciples, the Master said, “Some are very anxious to acquire
name and fame. They make a show of themselves. They travel in cars, build clock towers and
sky-scrapers. They wear costly dress and employ a number of servants. They pose as great servants
of society. Every moment they try to get more fame. But the slightest criticism upsets them. They
cannot bear opposition. They wish that everyone should respect them. In spite of all this they do not
get the fame they seek and hence get upset and restless.

“But if a man is really selfless he will not care for name and fame. He will do his work with
great interest but will not expect any reward for it. Work itself is his reward. He has no desire for
fame. He can bear abuse. Only such a man will enjoy peace. He will get fame also; it will be his
handmaid. But he will not be attached to it. Such a one alone can do real service to society.

“Give up all desire for fame. Work in a spirit of dedication. You will enjoy bliss. You will

get fame also. Work with single-minded devotion and dedication.”

SWAMI PRANAVANANDA

Born in 1908 to devoted parents at Alaveddi in Ceylon, Sri Ponniah, as he was known in his
Purvashram, left for Malaya in 1925 and lived in his adopted country till his death. Even while he
was working, he was actively participating in the cultural, spiritual and religious activities in Kuala
Lumpur, notably of
the Vivekananda Ashram, Theosophical Society, Malayan Arulneri
Thirukootam and the Divine Life Society of which latter he was the president for over seven years.
In 1959, while at the D.L.S. Headquarters at Rishikesh, he was initiated into the monastic order by
Gurudev Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj himself. Interestingly enough, when Sri Ponniah became
H.H. Sri Swami Pranavananda Saraswati, he was still in service, an administrative assistant in the
Rubber Research Institute of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, in which post he continued till his retirement
in 1963. He was nominated to the Board of Management of the D.L.S. in 1958 and made a patron of
the Society in 1963. H.H. Sri Swami Pranavananda Saraswati, who was a paradigm of perfection in
his secular and spiritual life, entered into eternal rest in 1982 March, leaving an unbridgeable gap in
the spiritual fraternity in general and Divine Life fraternity in particular.

SURRENDER AND GRACE

By Swami Sivananda

If you want to drink the spiritual nectar of immortality which flows from the holy lips of the

Guru, you will have to be an embodiment of humility and meekness.

The lower nature of mind must be thoroughly regenerated. The aspirant says to his
preceptor: “I want to practise Yoga. I want to enter into Nirvikalpa Samadhi. I want to sit at your
feet. I have surrendered myself to you”. But, he does not want to change his lower nature and habits,
old character, behaviour and conduct.

One’s individual ego, preconceived notions, pet ideas and prejudices, and selfish interests
should be given up. All these stand in the way of carrying out the teachings and instructions of one’s
Guru.

Lay bare to your Guru the secrets of your heart. The more you do so, he will help you in the

struggle against sin and temptation.

The aspirant, before he desires the grace of the Master, should deserve it. The supply of

divine grace comes only when he is fit to receive it.

Guru’s grace descends upon those who feel utterly humble and faithful to him. Faith is
confidence and trust in Guru. Faith is firm conviction of the truth of what is declared by the
preceptor by way either of testimony or authority, without any other evidence or proof. The disciple
who has faith in the Guru argues not, thinks not, reasons not and cogitates not. He simply obeys,
obeys and obeys.

PREFACE

Late revered Sri Swami Pranavanandaji Maharaj was a precious gem and a jewel among the
brotherhood of the numerous disciples of beloved and worshipful Swami Sivanandaji’s spiritual
family. His deep understanding of the essential spirit of discipleship to his great Guru has made him
one among the ideal disciples in the vast global spiritual family of Gurudev. His total sense of
devotion and dedication to his Guru was an inspiration to the beholder. I have been greatly inspired
and benefited by his company and through his example. He has set a high standard that would serve
as a model to all seekers and disciples. He shone as a great example of true discipleship.

In spite of much that has been written on the concept of a spiritual Guru, there is still a good

deal of confusion, misunderstanding and scepticism in the public mind on this vital matter.

Is a Guru absolutely necessary? Who is a Satguru? How far can he help his Chela (disciple)?
What are the duties of a disciple? What is the meaning of Initiation? Want of clear-cut and definite
answers to these and related questions often impedes the spiritual progress of earnest aspirants.

v

to

his

imparted Self-knowledge

Spiritual knowledge is a matter of Guru-Parampara. It is handed down from Guru to his
disciple. Gaudapadacharya
disciple Govindacharya;
Govindacharya to his disciple Sankaracharya; Sankaracharya to his disciple Suresvaracharya.
Matsyendranath imparted knowledge to his disciple Gorakhnath; Gorakhnath to Nivrittinath ;
Nivrittinath to Jnanadeva. Totapuri imparted knowledge to Sri Ramakrishna, and Ramakrishna to
Swami Vivekananda. It was Ashtavakra who moulded the life of Raja Janaka. It was Lord Krishna
who made Arjuna and Uddhava get themselves established in the spiritual path when their minds
were in an unsettled state. The entire history of the Hindu people has been sanctified and uplifted by
the unbroken succession of these rare spiritual Personalities. The Guru-Sishya relationship is
indeed the divine link that holds together the past and the future. This Guru-Sishya society is the
foundation of the Hindu Culture and its Vedic tradition. Swami Pranavanandaji Maharaj ever
aspired to fulfil this ideal of perfect discipleship during his own lifetime.

We bow in silent reverence and admiration to this noble soul!

LETTERS, MESSAGES AND CERTIFICATES

1st October, 1952

His Holiness Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj,
Ananda Kutir, Rishikesh,
The Himalayas.

Revered Swamiji Maharaj,

Prostrations and humble salutations.

The thought of writing to Swamiji for blessings was in the mind of this humble self for
sometime but it did not materialise until now, having been inspired by the receipt of a sample copy
of the “Divine Life” which came as a pleasant surprise a few days ago. Apparently some good
friend has kindly given my address and as the cover was opened an inexpressible delight was
experienced that it was Swamiji’s blessings.

The writer is a spiritual aspirant, 43 years old, bachelor, vegetarian for over 27 years,
teetotaller, non-smoker and of active habits. For several years, have been a worker and held
executive positions in various cultural and religious institutions notably, the Vivekananda Ashram,
Selangor, Theosophical Lodge, Hindu Prachara Sabha, the Shuddha Samajam (Pure Life Society),
Indo-Ceylon Association. In 1948 when on a visit to India received the blessings of Sri Ramana
Maharshi; had Darshan of Sri Aurobindo and the Holy Mother; also blessings of Yogi Sri
Shuddhananda Bharatiar. Owing to leave exigencies it was not possible then to go up to Rishikesh
but I am very hopeful that during latter half of 1953 my desire may be fulfilled by at least a
fortnight’s stay at Swamiji’s Ashram, to receive personal blessings and instructions. The early
years of my life were full of disappointments and struggle—fights against destiny. The labours
were not lost. Like a dream those years have gone but they have helped me to evolve—blessings in
disguise.

I am employed in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya since 1929 and through the
Lord’s grace have risen to a reasonable position of trust and responsibility in the service. The
responsibilities in the family, which had to tell very much on my life, are practically over and with
the demise of my beloved mother in March 1952 my interests in life have begun to dwindle. My
fervent desire is to take up some form of diversion of career in which there would be chances of
serving humanity on a broader basis. Swamiji’s blessings are earnestly requested.

The form of membership and enrolment as subscriber to the Divine Life are returned
herewith duly completed. A sum of Rs. 50 has been remitted to Swamiji’s address by money-order.
Anxiously awaiting thy blessings and message. Pranams and reverential salutations.

Yours in the service of the Lord,
N. Ponniah

Beloved Self,

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

Thy kind letter. Glad to note that you have got a spiritual mind and you have got good habits
and character. Keep the same and proceed in the spiritual path. You will attain the Goal of
God-realisation in this very birth.

Follow the enclosed instructions1 in your daily walk of life. You will evolve quickly. Keep a

spiritual diary and send me a copy of the same at the end of every month for further guidance.

You can serve the humanity by opening a Branch of our Society in your place and holding

Satsang, etc. Rules are enclosed.

Herewith Temple Prasad. May God shower His blessings on you.

Beloved Immortal Self, Salutations and adorations.

Delighted to peruse your valuable, highly illuminating article on your visit to the Ashram.
You have nicely expressed many important points in a humorous manner. I will have it published in
the next issue of ‘Divine Life’ Magazine and include the same in one of our books. When it goes to
the Press, I will remember and take out 100 copies extra and send them to you.

A GREAT GURU AND THE IDEAL DISCIPLE

12th June, 1954.

Revered Immortal Self,

Salutations and adorations.

With deep interest I go through your kind letter of the 31st ultimo. Thanks very much for

your valued contribution. It is very kind of you indeed.

I closely follow the situation in K.L. and understand everything nicely. Your decision and
method of work is the best under the circumstances: to adjust and adapt, not to lose any one, to bear
insult and injury, to develop patience and perseverance. This is the essence of Yoga. This is the
foundation for the real spiritual evolution. You have had considerable experience during the last 25
years. May the Lord crown your efforts with success. May you live as a model to the world. If other
members are to follow this method and work on constructive lines, we could have done miracles
and wonders by this time for the whole of Malaya.

The Yoga Asana class is a necessity. Even if with 2 or 3 members, let this continue with a
short prayer, Kirtan and a little study of philosophical works on holidays. That will inspire many.
All will tread the spiritual path and lead a peaceful life. By such silent method of work, release of
bulletins, articles through newspapers, solid work can be turned out in a short period. There is no
room for any misunderstanding, with anyone. Now the people have a correct lead by experienced
hands and I am sure the D.L.S. will become a dynamic Centre for the whole of the Far East. I will
help you all and guide you all and take a keen interest in all the activities. Kindly convey my best
wishes to other members and office-bearers.

Sri Natarajan will nicely support and co-operate with you all. His translation of
Sivananda-Jyoti should come out in a book-form. It is nothing. If four people join together, it can be
released and sold like hotcakes. That contains the essence of my writings. I thought of a Publishing
House for Malaya seriously. Such publications can easily be sold out. Let there be a series of Tamil
and English editions. That will become self-supporting and help the Head Office also a lot. May the
Lord crown your efforts with sanguine success. May the Lord bestow on you inner spiritual
strength, peace of mind and Kaivalya. Om Santih!

With Prem and Om,
Thy own Self,
Sivananda

18th November, 1954

Revered Self,

Salutations.

Sri S. Natarajan of Tamil Nesan writes to me on the 11th November that the translation of
Siva Gita is nearing completion and that he would hand over the MSS. to your good self in the
course of a week. Trust you have the matter with you. On receipt. kindly send the same to me per
Registered Air Mail Post. Kindly also get a Photo of Sri. S. Natarajan.

When the facility is here, I will print it in a book-form here. I wanted to have one edition in
Malayan, for wide circulation. Is there any possibility of releasing this as a book? Some publisher
should come forward to bring out a series of books in English and Tamil in Malaya and to organise
their sales in a systematic manner. That will pay them also. Now in Germany and Switzerland, there
is a great spiritual awakening. There is a Sivananda Press in Germany and a number of books in
English and German languages. Some volumes are expected in French language also. There is a
Journal entitled “Yoga” with my writings. For dissemination of knowledge this is a dynamic way.
May Lord bless you. Om Santih !

Thy kind letter of the 5th January, 1955.

I have received the manuscript of the Tamil translation of Sivananda Gita that you have sent
with the above letter. I shall have it printed here, as soon as the present work in the press is
completed. Kindly send me, in the meantime, a photograph of Sri Natarajan and also a group
photograph of the principal Kuala Lumpur D.L.S. people. These will be included in the book. You
may also, in due course, send me a brief note in Tamil about the activities of the Malayan Branches
of the D.L.S. for inclusion in the book.

Kindly let me know how many copies of the book you would require for distribution there
and if you are collecting any donation there for the publication of the book. May God bless you !

Revered Self,

Salutations and adorations.

Sometime back I received your kind letters. I felt happy to hear about the activities of the

Divine Life Society, Kuala Lumpur.

I note all what you write about Sivananda Gita. The impressions of your visit to Rishikesh
and activities of the Society in Kuala Lumpur will definitely add a special charm and beauty to the
book.

I note you have sent your valuable contribution to the Hospital. This is an important work. I
wish to develop this. This brings good to the sick, poor and Mahatmas here and the workers find this
as an effective form of ‘Practical Yoga’.

Sri Natesa Iyer had been here with his son. Leaving his son at the Ashram, he has gone on a

tour to South India. His son is very happy and cheerful. He leads a beautiful life.

Whenever you can spare time, kindly write to me about your welfare.

Thy kind letter with your valued contribution, Rs. 300- towards the publication of Siva Gita.
It is very kind of you indeed. I have noted that the publication will be dedicated to your beloved
parents. Yes, the report of your visit to the Ashram will be included. I will make necessary
arrangements for the purchase of paper, etc. When you expect all the 1,000 copies for Malaya, then
I will have nothing for distribution in India. There are many Tamil knowing public highly interested
in India. I need a few thousands of copies, but in this publication at least 500 copies will be a
necessity for India. There are over 20 books pending in the Press. Every month a dozen journals are

Adorable Self,

Salutations.

Thy kind letter of the 4th instant.

Yes, Siva Gita—500 copies will be sent to you for distribution in Malaya. I will use the
remaining 500 copies for the Tamil knowing people, important Branches of the Divine Life Society
and visitors.

I will gladly await the Sunday Editions of the Tamil Nesan with the Moksha Gita. Even
people in the West have greatly appreciated the Moksha Gita. In spite of the busy hours of Sri
Natarajan, he is doing a lot to the people of Malaya by the release of my writings in the Tamil
Nesan.

Sri Natesa Iyer’s son was perfectly all right in the Ashram. He was very peaceful, healthy
and happy. He was regular in his bath, meals, Puja in the Mandir and slept nicely. I gave him the
Ayurvedic Tonic. He was much benefited by the daily Satsanga. A sudden thought—he left this for
South India in a minute’s notice.

Sri Mrinal Kanti Paul is writing to me. I will be glad to support him. Yes, be in touch with
the gentleman in Lower Perak (Hindu Sabha). You may give me his address. I will encourage him
with necessary instructions for organising a Centre of Divine Life Society. Whenever you find it
convenient, kindly take up such short tours. People need you and your lessons on Yoga Exercises.
The whole of Malaya will be greatly indebted to you.

To H.H. Sri Swami Sadanandaji
Revered Immortal Self,

Om Namo Narayanaya.

I received a fine letter from Sri N. Ponniah:

“What a great pleasure it was, and I spent 5 memorable days with Sri Swami Sadanandaji
before going to Bangkok and two days on my return. I had occasion to participate in and listen to
him at spiritual groups and interviews and to attend some of his lectures in English and Tamil. They
are simply marvellous: profound scholarship, masterful treatises, flowing eloquence, apt quotations
and illustrations, intuitional vibrations, due emphasis on Sadhana, magnetic influence—through
these the Swamiji has made an indelible impression resulting in a great spiritual awakening”.

I receive similar letters from many of the students and devotees. You have sown the seed of
a dynamic Mission in Malaya by your visit. On firm grounds, with a committee of prominent
persons, establish Divine Life Centres in various places, wherever you go. That will be a solid work
that you do during this extensive travel in Malaya. May God bless you. Kindly be sending reports of
your movements.

Please take great care of your health. Ample rest, nutritious food, plenty of

fruit-juice—remember these. They are essential when you are in the active field.

others liberate themselves.

Birthday Message

MESSAGE OF PEACE

All the problems facing mankind today hinge on Peace. Given the secret of securing peace,
man will be able to build up a sane civilisation, prosperous society, happy home, and intelligent
individual. Groping blindfolded in the dark, man lays hold only on a series of destructive
media—the atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb, the most “effective” ways of using them, and the
hateful ideologies of political self-aggrandisement, economic monopoly, national glory and
individual power.

The “peace” that prevails today is the peace of fear and the peace of preparation. Ignoring
the sincere advice of men of wisdom, the great nations of the world are intent upon demonstrating
their destructive strength. That way lies the war, not peace.

Peoples belonging to different religions, different nations, and different classes or castes,
stir up jealousy, ill-will and hatred towards others, in the fair name of religion, patriotism, and
various other ’isms forgetting for the moment that what divisions exist in the structure of society
today are there for the convenience of man and for the promotion of commonweal.

This disharmony arises in the heart of man, infects the household first and gradually spreads
to the society, and then the nation and the world at large. No amount of re-adjustment of the social
structure and revolutionisation of political set-up will bring permanent peace. Even where these are
necessary they should spring from the heart of man, for the sake of humanity.

11

A GREAT GURU AND THE IDEAL DISCIPLE

Peace is the nature of the innermost Self of man. Santo Ayam Atma. He who even strives to
realise this Self, who has begun to direct his attention towards this Self, enjoys this peace that
prevails in the Self. Even as the nuclear explosion spreads destruction for miles around, this
superphenomenal experience of the Peace of the Self generates the powerful current of Peace that
dispels the darkness of ignorance and disharmony from the heart of everyone who attunes oneself to
the Yogi of such experience. Even a few Yogins of inner spiritual experience of Self-realisation can
transform the whole world and bring peace, plenty and prosperity. For, millions devoted to them
will share the spiritual treasures acquired by them. They will begin to feel that the One Self dwells
in all, One Life lives in all, and One Cosmic Will expresses Itself through countless beings. They
will begin to see that all distinctions are man-made and that all boundaries are imaginary. They will
begin to think in terms of humanity, to practise the universal religion of cosmic love. This is the
road to peace.

Therefore, turn the gaze within. Shut the doors of the senses. Restrain the turbulent mind.
Slay, the doubting intellect. Fill your heart with the nectar of faith and devotion. Serve humanity
selflessly. Do japa. Concentrate. Meditate. Pray and wait. Seek the Peace within. Realise the Self.
Shine as a Yogi, the greatest benefactor of humanity. May God bless you all with health, long life,
peace, prosperity and Self-realisation.

—Swami Sivananda

Beloved Immortal Atman,
Salutations and adorations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

I am grateful and highly indebted to your venerable self for thy kind blessings and good
wishes. I cherish them greatly as I know they are the blessings of God conveyed through the pure
and noble heart of thy exalted self.

Great are the potentialities hidden in man. Great achievements are possible by sincerity of
purpose, purity of motive, intensity of application and tenacity of perseverance. The Greatest
Achievement of Self-realisation can be had here and now by the intensest aspiration and deepest
meditation. You are near and dear to God. You enjoy His manifold blessings. Strive every second to
realise Him. That is the greatest service to humanity you can render. Become a Jeevanmukta here
and now and radiate peace, bliss and wisdom.

May God bless you with health, long life, prosperity and Kaivalya Moksha

Blessed Self,

Salutations. Thanks very much for your valued offerings. The letter came just in time. I
accept the flowers with great joy. Many devotees came to the Ashram. Here it was a tremendous
spiritual Conference with collective prayers, Sadhana, Satsanga, Bhajan and Kirtan for some days.
Just now I am a bit free. I hope the D.L.S. members will send me a report of the Birthday
celebrations there. Already some devotees have written to me. Hope you are regularly receiving the
publications of the Society. I send you my best wishes. May the Lord bless you with prosperity,
good health and long life.

With regards and Prem,

Beloved Atman,

Salutations and adorations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

I am grateful to your noble self for sending me a copy of the beautiful ‘Merdeka Souvenir’

of the Tamil Nesan. It is beautifully got up and highly interesting.

Political freedom by itself is but a steppingstone to cultural and eventually spiritual
freedom. Two things are essential for its true fulfilment: (1) that the country quickly revives the
ancient spiritual traditions of the East, and (2) that the people do not indulge in any kind of
vindictive actions against the erstwhile rulers. Independence should broaden the peoples’ outlook
and make them cultivate all embracing love. All nations should unite in love with an earnest desire
to preserve world peace.

Blessed Self,

Salutations and adorations.

Your kind letter of the 4th instant with highly interesting news. I thank you very much. I felt
very happy to see the Nanneri Vilakam. Blessed Natanam is carrying on a solid work in a silent
manner. I have not yet seen the Pongal Malar. It gives me great joy to hear about Mr. and Mrs.
Kandiah, Ponnudurai, and other devotees. I conducted a special prayer for the quick recovery and
perfect health of Revered Sri M. Thambipillay. May the Grace of the Lord be upon him. I heartily
welcome Sri Nagalingaswamy. Now the Ashram is much improved with all comforts and
conveniences. Sri Nagalingaswamy will feel quite at home here and enjoy the peace and bliss of this
ideal Centre. May God bless you!

With regards, best wishes, Prem and Om,

P.S.:—Your letters give me great pleasure. Whenever you can conveniently spare time,

kindly write to me.

Thy kind endorsement on the letter of Sri T.V. Zung. Sri T.V. Zung visited the Ashram. He
enjoyed the peace of this lovely centre. He is simple, but highly devoted. Glad to hear that you
helped him and his brother during their visit to Malaya. I am filled with immense joy to hear that he
voluntarily gave a donation for the Ashram in Batu Caves. The whole world will definitely support
the Divine Cause. Just a small beginning is what is wanted. May this centre grow and bring Light
and Knowledge to the whole world.

I send you my best wishes and best compliments.

A MESSAGE ON THE OCCASION OF OPENING OF THE UNIVERSAL PRAYER HALL

IN SIVANANDASHRAM, AT BATU CAVES, KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYA, ON 3rd

DECEMBER, 1960

Revered Immortal Self,

Salutations and adorations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

It is with great and inexpressible joy I send you this short message on the occasion of the

opening of the Universal Prayer Hall at Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpur, Malaya.

The history of the Divine Life Society and Sivanandashram, Kuala Lumpur has a special
significance and importance. It was about a decade ago that Swami Paramanandaji made elaborate
arrangements for my global tour. It was Malaya that first responded to receive me and hear me
there. On account of reasons of my health later on though the tour was cancelled, there in Malaya
sprang up a powerful Centre of Divine Life.

This Centre of Divine Life supervised by ardent devotees of the Lord, and managed by Sri
Sivananda Ponniah, its President, Sri S. Thuraiappah, its Vice-President, Sri Sivananda Boteju, its
Secretary and many others, has been a centre of spiritual power and attraction to devotees there.

Regular meetings were conducted at this Branch ever since its inception. From time to time
they have invited Mahatmas from the Headquarters (Rishikesh) and many other places. Sri Swami
Sadanandaji, Sri Swami Turiyanandaji and Sri Swami Vishnudevanandaji were the first three to
visit Malaya after its formation.

Interested members gathered around the Branch Centre and made it very strong. Gradually
the Sivanandashram came into being with a big scheme for constructive work. The first of the major
events in the branch’s activities is the construction of a Universal Prayer Hall which by the grace of
the Almighty Lord and untiring efforts of the office-bearers and members of the Kuala Lumpur
Branch, will be formally inaugurated on the 3rd December, 1960.

Again this day has a special significance for the Divine Life Society as a whole, because it
was on the 3rd of December, 1943, seventeen years ago, at the Rishikesh Sivanandashram, the
Akhanda Maha-Mantra Kirtan was started where, ever since that day, a continuous flow of Ram
Nam goes on day and night. Devotees sing the Names of the Lord, “Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama
Rama Hare Hare; Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare,” continuously day and
night.

So the opening of the Universal Prayer Hall on the 3rd December, definitely shows the
Divine Will and Divine sanction for the great work that the Malaya Divine Life Society propose to
do there.

21

A GREAT GURU AND THE IDEAL DISCIPLE

Prayer has a deep significance in the life of a Sadhaka. Prayer forms the be-all and end-all of
a spiritual life. With the exception of a very few highly advanced souls and born Jnanins like
Dattatreya, Vamadeva, Sadasiva Brahman, every aspirant has to pass through the stage of prayer at
one stage or other of his spiritual career and carry it on till the last day of his final illumination and
end of life’s journey here.

Prayer elevates you. It takes you high above the mundane sense-level and helps to have
communion with the Lord. There is a wonderful hidden force in prayer. It was the prayer of Dhruva,
Prahlada, Draupadi, Kunti and a long line of sincere devotees that brought the Lord from Vaikuntha
to our earth plane and enact the glorious Ramayana and the Divine sports of Brindavana by Sri
Rama and Sri Krishna respectively.

When all other remedies fail the suffering Jiva, it is prayer that comes to his aid and bestows
on him immeasurable joy and communion with the Lord. Prayer takes you to the door of intuition
and introduces you to the Lord and ultimately gives you final emancipation. Therefore prayer is a
Kamadhenu and Kalpavriksha for devotees. Hold on to prayer tenaciously till the last.

May the Universal Prayer Hall be a centre of spiritual activity for all time to come! May the
Prayer Hall bring peace, solace and joy to all spiritual aspirants in Malaya particularly and the world
at large.

May Lord bless you all devotees who attend the opening function with good health, long

life, peace, bliss and Immortality !

Om Santih, Santih, Santih. Om Peace, Peace, Peace!

Thy kind letter of the 24th December, ’60.

I agree with you that the stay of Sri Swami Vasudevananda will be a great help for the
progress of your work there. You can allow him time and convenience for deep study and
meditation at intervals. But if he is keen to come here first and then take up the work there you may
leave it to his choice. For day-to-day work of a routine nature you can give people to assist him and
he may be allowed to devote more time for personal Sadhana and he can fix up a particular time for
interview with visitors, etc. Thus he can serve both purposes. I always advocate this method.

I note what you write about Swami Jnanananda. He may be given such of the works as will
not affect the Ashram work and should enable him to improve himself nicely. The talents of every
selfless worker should be well utilised to the benefit of both the Ashram and the Sadhaka. A few

A MESSAGE

Today the banner of Divine Life is hoisted in Kuala Lumpur. The men, women and children
who gather under it are spiritual heroes. They have battled with the inner forces of darkness and
have emerged victorious. They blow the conch of “Om Om. Sivoham. Soham.” Armed with Viveka
(discrimination), Vairagya (dispassion), all divine virtues, and a keen longing for Liberation, they
are marching towards the Goal of Life, God-realisation.

The seeker after Truth is the hero par excellence. Na Ayam Atma Balaheenena Labhyah.
This Atman is not attained by the weak—was not said only of the body. Mental strength, the
strength of will, moral strength, and the inner spiritual strength are necessary for success in the
spiritual path.

The abode of the Atman has four gate-keepers—Santi, Santosh, Satsang and Vichar, or
Peace, Contentment, Company of the Wise, and Spiritual Enquiry. One who befriends them is
ushered into the Hall of God. Even if you befriend one of the Four, you will be the friend of all.
Diligently cultivate these virtues. Establish peace in thy heart: you will radiate peace and without
having to utter a word, you will establish peace in your community, country and the world at large.
Develop contentment; you will enjoy the Bliss of God here and now.

Satsanga is all-important, specially in these days, when man is assailed on all sides by
undivine forces. You cannot study all the scriptures of the world! But in Satsanga you get the
essence of all that knowledge. Satsanga in this age gives you the fruits of thousands of years of
Tapasya, and Sravana-Manana-Nididhyasana done in past ages.

This Satsanga Kendra is a boon. When you all assemble in the Ashram, God manifests
Himself there. He speaks through the learned. He sits by your side and listens to your Kirtan. He is
enthroned in your heart when you do Japa of the Mantra. He illumines your soul when you meditate
upon Him. This is the glory of Satsanga.

Sri Ponniah is a Spark of God. Sri Swami Jnananandaji is a Spark of God; Sri Sambantham
is a Spark of God. Sri Thuraiappah is a Spark of God; Sri Boteju is a Spark of God; Sri Arumugam is
a Spark of God. So, are all of you. When you all join together for the furtherance of this glorious
mission, what an infinite power is generated! Willing and joyous co-operation is necessary,

24

A GREAT GURU AND THE IDEAL DISCIPLE

particularly in spiritual undertakings, where wealth, power, name and fame are not the objectives
and incentives. Self-realisation is the prize! Kindly remember this always and plunge in selfless
service to promote the Divine Life Mission.

Take the message of Divine Life to more and more households. Sing His Names and Glories
and make others sing, too. Conduct meditation classes. Study Gita and explain it to others. Spread
the glory of truth, purity and love. Kuala Lumpur should become Kaivalya Dham, the Supreme
Abode of Immortality, Eternal Bliss and Supreme Peace.

May God bless you all! May the Batu Cave Ashram flourish as a dynamic centre of Divine

Life!

Thy kind letters of the 27th and 28th December, ’60. Sri N. Veeriah is welcome to this

to meet him when he comes.

Glad to know that you have arranged a new year function at the Sivanandasharm. You have
begun the new year very well. I am sure the Ashram will progress well under your able guidance
and cooperation.

You should have regular Sadhana courses and give practical training in Japa and silent
meditation in addition to periodical Satsanga gatherings and Sadhana weeks. Please utilise all
holidays for some special activity and Sadhana in the Ashram.

Glad to know that you had the chance to have the Satsanga of Sri Swami Yatisvaranandaji
Maharaj. He is a very learned and holy person. He commands high regard and respects from all his
adherents and Sadhaks in general.

May Lord bless you all with good health, long life, spiritual exaltation and Divine

communion!

inspiring activities for the good of the public. With your and other members’ co-operation
Sivanandashram, K.L. is sure to have a glorious future. It is my impression that you, Divine Lifers,
are bent on running it on ideal lines.

You should lay stress on more practical Sadhana, Japa, meditation, Satsanga, Svadhyaya,
etc., conducted regularly at the Ashram by a group of members. Collective Sadhana has wonderful
potency to change the nature of individuals. It will bring about unity and a spirit of co-operation for
all round betterment and improvement. There should be exchange of experiences and sharing of
views on a more intimate level. Gradually the Sivanandashram will become a spiritual retreat and
permanent blessing for Malaya and the world at large.

Glad to know that Swami Satyananda is improving.

Devotees wrote to me about the Maha Samadhi of Sri Swami Satyanandaji. On receipt of
the news, I conducted a special prayer at the Ashram Satsanga for the peace of the departed soul.
May the soul rest in Peace!

Sri Swami Satyanandaji was good enough to visit the Ashram here during his tour in India.
Though he spent only a short period at the Ashram, he was able to have a deep study of this
organisation. He moved with all the Sannyasins and Brahmacharins with great familiarity. He
expressed his great joy in coming to this Ashram. He was deeply impressed to see the dynamic work
turned out here. How serene, calm, collected, simple and sweet he was. He strived very hard in
Kuala Lumpur to establish an ideal institution for training thousands of aspirants in the spiritual
line. With grand and noble ideas, he established the Pure Life Society. He is known for his wisdom,
hard work, sacrifice. He ever lives in the heart of his devotees. Now he has nicely prepared the field
and a number of aspirants can gloriously prosper in the spiritual line by carrying out the aims and
objects of the Pure Life Society and I am sure that the members of the Pure Life Society will
continue the Divine Mission. May the seed sown by Sri Swami Satyanandaji grow brighter and
bring spiritual good to the whole world. Om Santih!

It is a great pleasure for me to send you this message on the occasion of the Annual General

meeting of your branch.

Salutations to the Divine Light that dwells in the innermost chamber of all beings! He is the
substratum of all existence; He is the never-changing reality behind these ever-changing
phenomena.

The indivisible, absolute and conscious nature of the Reality signifies that life on earth
should be lived according to the rigid laws of dispassion towards external existence and active
awareness of the Self as the unlimited being. It also shows that all forms of physical and even
intellectual indulgence are deviations from the eternal truth and that every desire for objectivation
of consciousness is suicidal in the real sense. The good life which is in conformity with the nature of
Truth should be therefore, free from the oppressions of hatred, lust, greed and falsehood in all their
forms of manifestation. The righteous life should be lived with mental peace, self-restraint, absence
of agitative activity, fortitude, faith in Truth and concentration of mental consciousness.

Blessed Immortal Atman,
Om Namo Narayanaya. Salutations.

Your letter. Noted the contents.

The ways of God are mysterious, but well-intentioned always. Humanity is His offspring.
He is guiding it towards Him in His own inscrutable ways. He makes the peoples all over the world
to undergo different experiences in order that they may understand His plan and live a higher life.
From the highest point of view the trouble and turmoil that the humanity faces every now and then,
which has been its fate ever since the creation began, is a logical necessity. May the Lord protect
India and bring Her to the glorious destiny which is Hers.

You have done a very good thing which is highly commendable for its beneficial results in
having conducted a Havanam and peace prayer-meeting. The faithful should place faith in Him and
carry on their struggle for Dharma. His power will do the rest. May God guide humanity towards its
destiny which is He Himself.

Thy own Atma,
Sivananda

Sri Chen Yoke Chun visited this place. He has spent here a nice time in the Ashram. He is a

very good and nice Sadhaka.

You are right. This year’s Birthday volume is very fine. There is appreciation from many
centres and devotees. As in the previous year this year too Sri Swami Paramanandaji was in charge
of that work. He gives full attention to it and works from January onwards.

May Lord bless you and your work in Malaya with sanguine success!

Blessed Immortal Self,
Om Namo Narayanaya. Salutations.

Your kind letter. I am enclosing herewith my message for the occasion of the marriage of
the devoted and pious Sri Navaratnam and Sri Yogambikai. May the Lord bless them with His
choicest gifts of spiritual and material things and make their life happy and beautiful.

Pleased to note the steady and increasing spiritual activities of the Ashram. That is the need
of the hour. It is only spiritual power that will unite elevate and harmonise mankind. Spirituality
which transcends all barriers which divide man from man, race from race, country from country
should be untiringly practised and promulgated. May God bless the humanity at large. My immense
appreciation for one and all of you who are engaged in this sublime spiritual mission. May you all
progress towards the goal very fast. I have conducted prayers for your health and peace and spiritual
progress.

With respects, regards, Prem and Om,

A Message

Thy own Self,
Sivananda

The world with all its beings as well as all other astral worlds with all their inhabitants of
celestial nature is the result of the interplay between Purusha and Prakriti—the Supreme Being and
its mystic power. Purusha is the Supreme Father, and Prakriti is the Supreme Mother, of all beings.
The Fatherhood of God is a very old conception taught by the Hindu Scriptures, which was adopted
by other Faiths founded later on this earth. The Supreme Being and His Power otherwise known as
Maya, Prakriti and so on are alone worshipped as Siva and Parvati, Krishna and Radha, Rama and
Sita, Muruga and Valli and so on. Man and woman are the very images of these two principles, viz.,
Purusha and Prakriti; without man and woman and communion between them there is no world,

53

and there will be no living beings. Thus we see that marriage between man and woman has a
tremendous and most sublime philosophy behind it. Their union on the physical level is the grossest
and the first aspect of their communion from the point of view of evolution, and their union on the
spiritual plane is the finest and subtlest and the last aspect of it. To merge or dissolve Prakriti in
Purusha is spiritual liberation or the realisation of the Oneness of Spiritual Consciousness, which
is the goal of Yoga and Vedanta.

When marriage and the entire relationship of man and woman on all levels are reviewed
from this angle, there is no vulgarity or sensuality in it, but only a fulfilment of a divine scheme, an
expression of a suprasensual or supernatural power or idea and an execution of a cosmic plan on
the individual level. Union between man and woman preserves the mankind in the first instance,
and leads them towards the final spiritual union, which is Moksha, in the last instance. There is
neither sin nor violation of any kind if relationship between man and woman is thoroughly in
conformity with this spiritual law. How changed the world would be if this is realised and practised
by all men and women of this ultramodern age! May Sri Navaratnam and Yogambikai live up to this
ideal and provide an example for others to follow.

—Sivananda

Revered Immortal Self,
Salutations and adorations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

Delighted to go through your kind letter of the 17th May, 1963 and the news of your
impending Annual General Meeting. I wish the branch a bright new year with wonderful progress
in every direction.

I am glad to know about the visit of Sri Giridhari Prasad, B.A., B.L., Hon. Magistrate of

Coimbatore. He is a very fine devotee full of devotion.

I am sure his presence amidst you was a great event of inspiration for all the members in
your branch and he on the other hand would be delighted to see so many earnest Divine Lifers in
that far-off country.

I am sending you a short message for the new year to be read out in the meeting of the

General Body.

May Lord bless you all with fine health, long life, joy, peace and happiness !

Blessed Immortal Atman,

Salutations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

I am pleased to send you this message on account of the Annual General Meeting of D.L.S.

Kuala Lumpur Branch to be held very soon.

Salutations to the Supreme Being who is Omnipresent, Omnipotent and Omniscient, who is
the Indweller of all hearts, who is the Creator, the Preserver, the Destroyer of everything.
Prostrations.

The indivisible, absolute and conscious nature of the Reality signifies that life on earth
should be lived according to the rigid laws of dispassion towards external existence and active
awareness of the Self as the unlimited being. It also shows that all forms of physical and even
intellectual indulgence are deviations from the eternal truth and that every desire for objectivation
of consciousness is suicidal in the real sense. The good life which is in conformity with the nature of
Truth should be, therefore, free from the oppression of hatred, lust, greed and falsehood in all their
forms of manifestations. The righteous life should be lived with mental peace, self-restraint,
absence of agitative activity, fortitude, faith in Truth and concentration of mental consciousness.

Oh ye aspirants, realise the meaning of the absolute in actual life, and march forward

accordingly and you are sure to attain the Goal.

May the function be a complete success.

May God bless you all with health, long life, peace and prosperity.

With regards, Prem and Om,

Thy own Self,
Sivananda

Most Revered and Gracious Gurudev,

Crores of humble Pranams at Thy Lotus Feet. Om Namah Sivaya!

The two certificates issued to this humble self on 8th April, 1963 under Gurudev’s
Bountiful Hand—one conveying the title “Guru Bhakti Ratna” and the other “Patronship” of the

57

A GREAT GURU AND THE IDEAL DISCIPLE

Divine Life Society—were received by registered post on the 1st instant. They gave me the most
pleasant surprise and filled my heart with inexpressible joy, conscious as I am of my smallness and
my undeservedness for any recognition of this sort. Since my first Darshan in 1953, I have always
received the greatest encouragement and solaceful messages which alone had kept me firm on the
path. To think that this humble soul has a place in the recess of Thy Gracious Heart which is replete
with unbounded Love and Compassion is the greatest boon in my life. Thou art Lord Incarnate on
earth and all Thy disciples and devotees are the most blessed. My heart-felt gratitude to Thy
Goodself cannot be adequately expressed in human language and in my feeble words. Two songs,
one from Thiruvasagam and the other from Kaivalya Navaneetam, come to my mind, and may I
quote them as expressive of great dedication:

To the Greatest of Living Gurus and Divine Masters, let me do my reverential prostrations!

Let me try to deserve all your kindness and spontaneous blessings! Prem and Om,

Thine in the service of the Lord,
Ponniah

Revered Immortal Self,

Salutations and adorations. Om Namo Narayanaya.

I am in receipt of your kind letter of the 6th June.

I am sending two copies of all latest books for review purposes as desired by you to Sri S.

Natarajan to his address.

I hope Sri Sivananda Boteju is with you and the branch activities are progressing well with

his help. I have not received any letter from him.

Sri A. Subramaniam, 494, Narenenpeta Road, Colombo-5, Ceylon is contemplating to
publish a new journal. The first issue will be out on the Guru Purnima day (6-7-’63). He needs the
help and encouragement of all branches. Sivanandashram, Kuala Lumpur also should publish a
periodical. It is strong enough to undertake this work. This is for your consideration.

May Lord bless you all with fine health, long life, joy, peace and happiness!

With deep regards, Prem and Om,

Thy own Self,
Sivananda
