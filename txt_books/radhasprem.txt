PUBLISHER’S PREFACE

This publication titled “Radha’s Prem” by Gurudev Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj is a
dramatic presentation of the various stages and phases of Supreme Divine Love, as illustrated in the
life of the exemplary symbol of devotion, Shri Radha Ji of Brindavan, in Her love for Lord Krishna.
The conversational depiction of the dramatis personae is eminently suited to present a histrionic
effect on the minds of the readers. The intention of the work is to highlight the Supremacy of Divine
Love or devotion as a pre-eminent way to God-realisation.

Usually, love, in common parlance, is construed as the medium employed by feeling by
which the lover and the beloved are brought in contact with each other in an experience of
communion, though normally two individuals cannot commune with each other by any amount of
mutual affection on account of the fact that individualities maintain their formal self-identity and
the one does not lose oneself in the other. Thus, mortal love, human affection, is an artificial
mechanism which promises a union of the lover and the loved one but never does really fulfil the
promise. Earthly love thus ends in sorrow, bereavement and death, since the principle of separation
is permanently at the back of even the attempted union through sensory and mental acts of mutual
contact.

Divine Love is of a different nature altogether. Persons who are enmeshed in thinking
through their physical body and the senses cannot arise to the level of a state of love which does not
require an object outside itself and therefore obviates the necessity for any endeavour for external
contact. Divine Love is the soul pouring itself on soul, the Infinite colliding with the Infinite in the
forms of perception and objects of cognition.

The life of Sri Krishna and the love of Sri Radha are a famous, lofty tradition come down to
us as beckoners to a superhuman form of spiritual longing quite unknown to the mind lodged in
physical matter or the bodily encasement. Through the pages of this book will be revealed
eminently the forms of Godly love and its ways which are an eludingly multifarious variety. The
Rasa Panchadhyayee of the Srimad Bhagavata is supposed to be the quintessential narration of the
dramatic enactment through which Divine Love manifests itself in action and ecstasy. The author, a
great saint and sage, caters through these pages an excellent treat for the benefit of all devotees
throughout the World.

FOREWORD

Civilised society is afflicted with a number of diseases. Some of them are disreputable and
the latter, scepticism and irreligion are two widely prevalent
some fashionable. Amongst
afflictions. The modern man takes pride in his fashionable maladies. In their negative aspect, the
complaint remains in the form of a general disbelief. In this stage it is not so dangerous. In a more
virulent stage it assumes the form of criticising and attacking religion,
traditional belief,
long-cherished ideas and time-honoured truths. In this form it is a serious and complicated
combination of Asuric blasphemy, obstinate egoism and aggressive agnosticism. The purblind
vision of the patient then perceives defects in divinity, dark carbon in the dazzling diamond and
base passions in the very perfection of spiritual purity and divine love. To counteract these dire
maladies, a new technique of divine ray-therapy is necessary. There is no other method. Treat him
with divine rays of spiritual knowledge and let him absorb the light emanating from the Jnana Surya
of the spiritual realm and the patient will be affected and the jaundiced vision of disbelief will give
place to a true insight and understanding of the real nature of the divine frame, the Radha-Krishna
Tattva and the glory of the divine nature, the devotee’s love and potency of the Divine Name.

This brilliant little play forms such a course of spiritual treatment. This revealing light ray
will surely penetrate into the diseased system of those that fail to see the glory of divine love in its
proper light and open their inner vision, bestowing devotion and faith unto them.

The absolute purity of the Gopi’s hearts by far surpasses the Himalayan snow. Become

pure. Then you may understand just a little of the grandeur of divine love.

INTRODUCTION

Salutations to Sri Radha, the World-Mother, who took her birth at Barshana, near

Vrindavan, who is an embodiment of Sri Krishna Prem!

The supreme emotion, Mahabhava,

is the quintessence of Prem. Radha is the
personification of this Supreme Emotion. The play of Radha with Sri Krishna is extremely deep; it
cannot be learnt from the Dasya, Vatsalya and other Bhavas. The Sakhis alone are qualified for it.
They alone relish this Leela in full. Sakhis, or those who worship Sri Krishna in the spirit of His
Sakhis, have a right to this Leela.

A Sakhi does not yearn to play with Krishna all by herself. She feels a keener delight in
contriving Krishna’s dalliance with Radha, Radha is indeed the Wish-yielding Creeper, Kalpalata,
of the love of Krishna. The Sakhis are the leaves, flowers, and shoots of the creeper. If the nectar of
dalliance with Krishna waters the creeper, the leaves, etc., take delight in it million times more than
if they themselves had been watered.

The Sakhis do not long for Sri Krishna’s embrace, but they exert themselves to make Sri
Krishna embrace Radha. They send Krishna to her for this purpose under various pretexts. They
attain thereby a bliss million times sweeter than that of selfish enjoyment. The unselfish devotion of
these towards each other strengthens the deliciousness, Rasa. The sight of such unselfish, pure
Prem pleases Lord Krishna. The love felt by the Gopis, is not really earthly lust. Earthly lust seeks
sensual gratification for one’s own self. The Gopis abandon all idea of self and seek Krishna’s
enjoyment. They did not yearn for their own pleasure. They embrace Krishna only to please Him.

You cannot attain Krishna, however much you worship Him, if you only meditate on Him
as a Divinity and not serve Him as a Gopi. See how Lakshmi adored Him, but could not attain Him
in Vraja.

Radha is Devi. She is the queen of lustrous beauties and the abode of Sri Krishna’s
love-sports and worship. She beholds Lord Krishna in anything and everything she sets Her love-lit
eyes upon. Lord Krishna is the supreme matchless Lover and Sri Radha is identical with Krishna.
She is part and parcel of Krishna and His love-energy. Her sole object of existence and devout
prayers, is to fulfil the wishes of Sri Krishna. Hence She is named Krishnamayi by the Puranas. She
is full of Krishna inside and outside. Krishna is the charmer of all. Radha is Krishna’s charmer and
therefore the Supreme Goddess.

She is the worshipped of all the worshipped deities. She is the fosterer and mother of the
worlds. She is the presiding deity of the Lakshmis of Vaikuntha or of the six divine attributes of
Lord Krishna. She is the chief of Krishna’s divine energies. She is the seat of concentrated beauties
or the source and centre from which the Lakshmis draw their beauties.

Lord Krishna is the embodiment of bliss. He is the source and centre of real happiness. Bliss
is divine elixir that bestows immortality. Sensual pleasure is a poison which causes diseases and
death. Lord Krishna has a certain energy called Antaranga or Svarup Shakti. This Shakti which has
the power of giving delight to Krishna and His Devotees, is called Hladini Shakti or delight-giving

vi

energy. The essence of Hladini is Prem or selfless Krishna’s Prem. This selfless love is called
Ananda-Chinmaya-Rasa. The quintessence of this Rasa or Mahabhava is Radha.

Radha is the embodiment of Mahabhava. The word Radha etymologically means a devotee.
Radha is the chief of Krishna’s sweethearts. All the Lakshmis of Vaikuntha are Her Vilasa-Murtis.
The queens of Dwaraka are Her reflections. Lalita and other Gopis of Vrindavan are Her manifold
forms. She pervades the Gopis in Her subtle form in order to contribute to Krishna’s enjoyment.
Radha is Krishna’s delighter, charmer and life’s all. She is the queen of all the lovely maidens of
Vraja. She is the Crest-Gem of all celestial beauties. Radha and Krishna are inseparable as fire and
its heat, ice and its coolness, the flowers and its fragrance.

The body of Radha is made up of sweet tenderness and loveliness for Sri Krishna. The
substance of her subtle form as Mahabhava is Krishna Prem. Ardent passion for Sri Krishna is her
dress. Her sweet radiant smile is the camphor. All good qualities are her garlands. All the Bhavas
form the ornaments, her limbs. Lord Krishna’s name, qualities form the ornaments of Her ears.
Krishna’s name and qualities flow out in a stream from Her tongue. She serves Krishna with the
drink of Premarasa or Shyama-rasa.

The culmination of Bhakti is reached in Madhurya-Bhava. The lover and the Beloved
become one through the intensity of love. Radha had this type of love. In Madhurya-bhava there is
the closest
relationship between the devotee and the Lord. There is no sensuality in
Madhurya-Bhava. There is no tinge of carnality in it. Passionate people cannot understand this
Bhava as their minds are saturated with passion and lower sexual appetite. In the secular sphere the
only “love” which approaches this Bhava to an appreciable nearness is the love, a grown-up son has
to his mother. Here, there is not even a semblance of the sex-element prevalent. Is there the least
carnality in the love, a son has for his mother? Sufistis saints also have the Bhava of lover and the
beloved (Madhurya-Bhava). Gita Govinda written by Jaya Deva is full of Madhurya-Rasa. The
language of love which the mystic uses cannot be comprehended by worldly persons. Only Gopis,
Radha, Mira, Tukkaram, Narada, Hafiz, can understand the language.

Glory to Radha, the consort of Lord Krishna! Glory, glory to Lord Krishna, the Joy of
Devaki, the goal of Yogis, the refuge of devotees, and the delight of Yasoda and Nanda. May their
blessings be upon you all!

RADHA’S PREM

SYNOPSIS

The drama that is now presented before you purports to bring out clearly the sublimity of the
Path of Devotion to the Lord and also the essential unity underlying the three main-Paths. Truth is
one; sages call it variously. By whichever route you ascend, you reach the same peak. This truth is
brought out in the five scenes of this drama. Jnana Dev, a votary of the Yoga of Synthesis, is the
principal character. To him is allotted the task of propounding the great ideas lying hidden under the
surface of apparently commonplace-acts of the Divine Avatars. The Leelas of Krishna who
incarnated on this earth to bring home to humanity the greatness of Bhakti Yoga and who through
his actions, taught humanity for all time the technique of devotion, are taken up by Jnana Dev and
analysed. In the first two scenes, Prem Das’s doubts and difficulties regarding the Leelas are
cleared. Murkharaj, a man steeped in worldliness, plays a leading role in the next two scenes. Jnana
Dev, by his scholarly expositions and practical illustrations is able to convert him into a Bhakta. In
the last scene Atmanandaji, another Bhakti-Yogi, joins hands with Jnana Dev and in the end
Murkharaj becomes a completely changed man, as it were, and even undertakes to preach the Yoga
of Synthesis to the world at large.

The one seemingly paradoxical feature in Sri Krishna’s Avatara which has heckled the
innocent and semi-wise Bhakta and which has provided formidable and poisonous ammunition to
the crooked disbeliever in devotion for use against such a Bhakta, has been Sri Krishna’s Rasa
Leela with the Gopis. The first scene brings out clearly the most appropriate answer to the quixotic
questions of this type of perverted intellect which cannot conceive of human relationship between
man and woman other than through the medium of the flesh, the nobler spiritual love which
permeated—nay was part and parcel of the Gopis. The Adwaitic Bhav of Para Bhakti is vividly put
before you by Sri Jnana Dev.

This scene is illustrative of the qualities of Para Bhakti—absolute effacement of the ego and
complete self-surrender. A Supreme Bhakta never for a moment stops to think about himself, but
has the joy of his beloved Lord—and that alone—before him. He loses himself in the service of his
Lord—an ideal Karma Yogin. There is complete oneness between him and his Lord—the peak of
Adwaita. Sri Radha’s attitude towards Krishna is taken to illustrate this; and an incident in their life
is narrated. To remove the jealousy which the other Ranis entertain towards Radha, Sri Krishna
pretends that he has intense pain in the stomach and wants the Charanamrita of a Bhakta, the only
medicine. None except Radha (who forms the ideal for a Bhakta to emulate) is willing to give this
medicine to Krishna. Every one thinks of his or her own happiness, in this world or in the other; but
Radha has the only aim of removing the Lord’s pain and so, unmindful of her friends’
remonstrances, gives the “medicine”!

The third scene brings the Sakara and Nirakara Dhyanins nearer each other—in fact they
merge into each other. The wide gulf of superstitious belief against Sakara or Nirakara Upasana is

SYNOPSIS

Scene V

bridged. It is shown, again by means of intelligent reasoning, how one is as essential as the other in
the different stages of the evolution of man and how one smoothly leads to the other.

Scene IV gives a convincing scientific simile to show the effect of repeating the Name. It
also brings down those who live in the Fool’s Paradise, like Murkharaj, thinking they will do Kirtan
and Japa when they are old and dying. By means of simple illustrations it brings home the necessity
of repeating the Lord’s Name incessantly till the Goal is reached.

Again, in the fifth scene there is a happy fusion of the different paths. Another incident in Sri
Krishnavatara is taken up as a main theme. The jealous gopis steal Sri Krishna’s flute and break it.
Sri Krishna explains the significance of his flute and also the philosophical truth behind it. The flute
is the ideal of a Yogi. It empties itself so that it may be filled with more and more of the Lord’s
Divine music, thus qualifying itself to the privilege of ever remaining nearest and dearest to Him. In
Divine ecstatic music the flute and the Lord become one and all duality disappears. So, can a Yogi
become a Bhakta through selfless service and then even the duality of being nearest and dearest to
the Lord disappears when he attains Para Bhakti and identifies himself with the Beloved.

[Sri Jnana Dev gives an absorbing discourse on Skandha X (Chapter 29—33) of the
Bhagavata describing the sublime Rasa Leela. At the end of the lecture, after the others have left the
Ashram, Prem Das approaches Jnana Dev, prostrates before him]

Prem Das: May I crave the indulgence of Your Holiness to clear a doubt which afflicts my

mind, Swamiji Maharaj?

Jnana Dev: Yes, my child. I am always at the service of sincere aspirants. Go ahead. You

need not stand on any formality with me.

Prem Das: Swamiji,

the people nowadays make contemptuous references to Lord
Krishna’s Rasa Leela. Though I feel that there must be a sublime truth behind His Leela, I am not
able to offer satisfactory explanation to those vile critics, whom I have to face very often during the
course of my Sankirtan tours. I shall be eternally grateful to you if you will kindly throw some light
on this Mystery.

Jnana Dev: What exactly is your difficulty?

Prem Das: According to the Code of Dharma, it is adultery to remain in the company of
wives of other persons, to entice them and to sport and dance with them secretly. Is Lord Krishna to
be condemned for His conduct in this respect during Rasa Leela?

Jnana Dev: Ah! A really pardonable doubt. Just listen to this marvellous incident I am going
to narrate to you and reflect on its deep import. The women of Vraja once asked Lord Krishna to
name some Brahmin to whom they could offer food. Lord Krishna named “Durvasa”. The Gopis
asked: “How can we approach him? There is the Yamuna which is in floods. How are we to cross it?
Name some other Mahatma, please”. The Lord said “Request Yamuna in the name of Nitya

4

SCENE I

Brahmachari Krishna to give way and it will instantly do so. The Gopis were amused, and though
sceptic, did as requested and lo! the river at once gave way for the perplexed Gopis to cross it;
Yamuna indeed knew the real Svarupa of Krishna, the spotless divine purity that He was! He was a
Nitya Brahmacharin.

Prem Das: That is a story I have often heard. But how can that be? He spent a whole night

with the Gopis and is said to have married 16,008 wives!

Jnana Dev:—It all sounds curious to you, doesn’t it? Lord Krishna’s Rasa Leela is a
mystery of mysteries. “Go” means a Jiva or Ego. Gopala means the protector of Jivas. “Go” means
also Prithivi or this earth or in other words the Prakriti as distinguished from the Purusha Supreme.
All Jivakotis are Prakriti-sambhava. Gopala means the Lord and the protector of the entire
Jiva-rashis. Krishna means a kishora, i.e., a person between 7 and 12 years of age. At the centre of
Vrindawan, is the octagonal Yoga-seat of Sri Krishna. He is the Lord of it. Brahma, Vishnu and
Siva are His parts. His primal Prakriti (life element by which He upholds the whole Universe) is
Radhika. Govinda with Radha is seated on the golden throne, on the seat of Yoga with his
favourites, Chandravati, Chitrarekha, Chandra, Madana Sundari, Sri Madhumati, Chandrarekha,
Hari-priya. The latter were His chief Sakhis (Pat Ranis).

Prem Das: You are puzzling me further. But how does all this excuse the actions of

Krishna?

Jnana Dev:—Yes, I will tell you. But it seems preposterous to me. I should attempt to
explain this transcendental mystery to you. Who can presume to explain the Rasa Leela? What
mortal mind can approach, even in its wildest flights of imagination, the divinity, the sublimity of
Rasa Leela of the Lord? Words are of no avail. The tongue fails. The poor mind or the intellect
cannot reach the heights of Truth. No one can really explain the Truth, this Mystery, to any one else.
Nor can any one grasp this sublime Leela from another’s lips. Haven’t you read in the Gita:

A:`:y:(cid:252)v:t: p:Sy:et: ke`:d(cid:240)n:(cid:246) A:`:y:(cid:252)v:(cid:190)det: t:T:(cid:242)v: c:any:H .

One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder;
another hears of It as a wonder; yet, having heard, none understands It at all. (2.29)

God and His Leelas are not matters for discussion. They are for direct perception and

realisation. Ah, the Bliss that you get out of this realisation, that itself is indescribable!

Now, I was saying something about Radhika and the pat-Ranis. Next to these in importance
comes the group of Gopis. The Gopis were the medium for the Lord to express the infinite variety of
His Bliss aspect. They were, in their previous birth, the sages of Dandaka forest, who wanted to

5

RADHA’S PREM

embrace Rama. As Rama had taken the vow of “Ekapatnee-vrata” in that Avatar, he could not
accede to their request, but promised to fulfil their desire in His next Avatar as Krishna. The sages
were born as Gopis in their next birth for eventual merging into the Lord. They had their husbands,
their parents and sons, they had their worldly duties to perform, some of them arduous enough to
require constant attention. But the Gopis’ mind was always fixed on the Lord. When the time came
for the union with the Purusha of the Heart, when the signal music was heard, every Gopi shook off
all the bonds and offered herself up completely to the Lord. Nothing in the world could stop them.
This is the highest form of Bhakti. They present an ideal for us to keep always before us. How can
their glory be described?

Prem Das:—Excuse me, Maharaj. I am a bit dull-headed. Were not the Gopis guilty of

deserting their husbands and Krishna of seducing them with His music?

Jnana Dev:—No, Sri Krishna performed the Rasa Leela to destroy carnality by means of
pure love or Prema. When the Gopis approached their Lord, there was no human passion in them,
no love of human flesh, no idea of material gratification. It was the attraction of the soul for the
Oversoul. They placed themselves entirely at the service of the Lord. They were permeated with
Madhurya Bhav. The Lord only cared for their yearning to unite with Him and not for their external
status the worldly surroundings created by their Prarabdha Karma. The Vrindavana Leela is Nitya
or constant. The Rasa Leela is for all time for the true Bhaktas. It was meant to build up faith, to
strengthen spirituality, holiness, to improve the minds of the Gopis in particular and humanity in
general.

Prem Das:—May be. But how does it help us in our spiritual path? To a lay mind it all looks

as one of the things which happen in a man’s life which had better be forgotten.

Jnana Dev:—No. It was not merely a historical incident, but an eternal fact. The night is the
time of rest when spiritual activity sets in. There is complete absence of Loka Vasanas. Man gets
spiritual teachings and advancement during that period unconsciously. But it is only for a few who
have a conscious union with the Lord who manifests Himself in the heart of man. Many will have
dreamless and peaceful sleep but only few will enter the Turiya. Purusha is one Jiva Prakritis or
Para Prakritis are many. To Purusha the Jiva must always be negative, however positive it may be
towards the forms of Apara Prakriti. The Chaitanya is the Purushottama who generates bliss all
round the Purusha. There is no sex here. Purushottama is always the male and to Him Jiva Prakriti is
always a female. In devotional practice one should consider oneself a female, the male being the
Lord of the Universe, as reflected in the heart of the Bhakta. The Gopis were not of the world. They
had become purified by Tapas in their previous birth. In this birth they should merge in the Lord.
For the sake of the blind man who will not learn anything from the Sastras, they took the bodies of
gopis to show man how to love the Lord.

Prem Das:—You make my head reel by your explanation!

Jnana Dev: Truth is, as I said, strange, wonderful, deep in its import. Listen! They had every
right to the union with the Lord and Sri Krishna could not deny them his companionship. Nay, it
was a great thing to the Lord Himself, that the Jivas should return to Him with all their spiritual
experiences. The concession was natural and the joy was mutual.

SCENE I

Let not the dullness of perception or the mean lust of passion in man sit in judgment over
this final beatitude of human aspirations. But in the midst of the Union itself, there is a danger, a
most subtle one at that, that of the Egoism “I am in union with the Lord”. The Gopis thought of
themselves and there was an instant break in the union. Krishna could not be seen anywhere. They
imitated His actions in the world. They followed His footsteps wherever found. Tears rained down
their cheeks. They now realised that the Lord they wanted was not only the son of Yasoda but the
Lord of the Universe and they forgot their egoism in their wonderful realisation and lo! the Lord
appeared again. The best way to get rid of egoism is to forget it completely or to deny its existence
whole-heartedly. This time there was union but not individual union. Hand in hand, the Gopis
formed a circle with their Lord—not the individual Lord but the Universal Lord making Himself
many in their hearts as well as outside—and went on dancing with Him. The people of Vraja,
however, never missed their wives (Gopis) from their sides, through the Lord’s Yoga Maya! The
Devas looked with wonder and envied the lot of the Gopis. Let us catch a glimpse of that divine love
and dance—that Rasa Leela—so that men may become gods on earth. Study the Bhagawata with
faith and devotion. Though even that has its own good results by way of creating good Samskaras,
mere reading is not all. You should understand the meaning. Meditate on the sublime ideas
underlying each Leela of the Lord. The doors of the Great Secret will slowly, one by one, open to
reveal to your powerful, concentrated gaze, the immortal Truth that is apparently closed to human
vision through man’s ignorance. Once you tear this veil, you will realise you are the Lord
Himself—the state experienced by Radha.

Prem Das: Swamiji, our doubts about Rasa Leela have been melted away by the fiery

discourse you have given. We are immensely grateful to you.

(Prostrates).

Jnana Dev: (Sings).

Love is divine, Love is Prem, Love is nectar Love purifies, Love redeems, Love transmutes.
Cultivate pure Love in the garden of your heart. God is Love.
A life without love, faith, devotion is a dreary waste and real death.
Develop burning Vairagya, shed tears of Prem, you will meet now your beloved.

God bless you all. It is time for your food. By the way, are you going to stay here? (Prem
Das nods assent.) Oh! That is good. Saswat Swamiji, please attend to his comforts, give him food,
and take him to the room near the temple. Om Namo Narayanaya.

(Saswat Swamiji leads Prem Das—Exeunt).

SCENE II

(Next day evening at 8 p.m. all the devotees assemble in the verandah of Sri Jnana Dev’s
cottage. The Swami has specially illumined the hermitage as it was Radha Jayanti day. A large
picture of Sri Krishna playing the flute for Sri Radha to dance, is placed on a specially decorated
altar. Puja is performed by the Swamiji himself. Prayers are said in a melodious and resounding
chorus by the inmates led by Swamiji. All the time the Swami is engrossed in the Divine music and
Radha’s dance. Slowly he passes into a trance. A bright smile lights up his face. The gathering
looks on amazed at the sight and in a self-forgetting mood, begins to sing Kirtans. Slowly the Swami
comes back to consciousness. Prem Das who has all the time been watching what was going on is
visibly moved.)

Jnana Dev: Sings:(all others follow in chorus)

Mana Mohan Murli Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Gokul Mathura Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Raas Rachane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Gaiya Charane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Makhan Chorane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Ananda Dene Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Bansi Bajane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Gita Jnana Sunane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Giridhar Uthane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.
Kannaya Kahane Vale Tumko Lakhon Pranam.

On the most auspicious day of Radha Jayanti let us pray to Her to give us all intense
devotion to the Lord and lead us on to the light of Truth, Sri Krishna. Verily the Lord is more easily
moved when we approach Him through our Divine Mother; and it is a well-known fact that women
have an abundance of sympathy and affection overflowing in their heart. Lord Narayana is more
easily propitiated through Sri Lakshmi; Siva through Parvati. Sri Krishna through Radha. May you
all attain Para Bhakti and through Her Grace reach the sublimest heights of Vedanta where you feel
your oneness with the Lord!

Prem Das: Swamiji Maharaj! Your discourse yesterday provided much food for our
thought. The more we think of the Rasa Leela the more vividly does the Truth present itself before
us. Yesterday you made a passing remark to Radhika as the primal Prakriti of the Lord. Again you
said that all the thousands of Gopis had intense love for the Lord. Why then should there have been
partiality on the part of the Lord towards Radha? No doubt myself and my party of Sankirtanists
have always associated Radha with Sri Krishna in our Bhajan. But I must confess that I have never
bestowed any thought on the “why” of it. Yesterday it occurred to me after listening to your most
illuminating and simple discourse on Rasa Leela that you are the fittest soul to have this mystery
revealed to our eye.

Jnana Dev: You are really a divine child to have this inquiring mind. The general state in
which we find humanity today is that some have absolute blind faith in His Leelas and would not
question; others will not believe—the perverted intellectuals—and would go on vilifying His

8

SCENE II

Leelas without caring to enquire. Don’t you know the famous adage: For those who believe, no
explanation is necessary; for those who do not, no explanation is possible! On the one hand we have
to encounter overcredulousness, on the other, disbelief, scepticism, perversion. Meditate daily on
one of His Leelas; great truths will dance before you.

Radha is the Ananda aspect of the Sat-Chit-Ananda Brahman. Can a piece of sugar-candy
taste its own sweetness? This Lord in His inscrutable ways wanted to taste the Ananda of His own
Svarupa. And so, He projected Radha and Himself was born as Sri Krishna.

Now, then, listen to a small story. Once Sri Rukmini, Satyabhama and the six other Pat
Ranis referred to by me yesterday, had a discussion: “We all love and serve our Lord with great
devotion and sincerity but He does not bestow any attention on any of us. He always repeats
Radha’s name alone. We must ascertain from our Lord why she is so dear to Him”.

(Lord Krishna comes and He is garlanded by all of them. They sing and welcome Him.)

(Sri Krishna is extremely pleased at the very mention of Radha’s name; repeats “Radhe,
Radhe’ and is immersed in the bliss of the name “Radha”. The Ranis all stand at a respectable
distance watching this. Then pent-up emotion bursts out and tears rain down their cheeks. Sri
Krishna, still lost in his trance sits down. Rukmini gains control over herself after a little while,
signals to Nrityaranjini to dance and bring the Lord back to consciousness.)

Radha Krishna Bhajo Kunjabihari.
Muralidhara Govardhanadhari.
Sankha-Chakra Pitambaradhari.
Karunasagara Krishna Murari.

(Repeat first line four times.)

(Enter Nrityaranjini)

Sunaja Sunaja Sunaja Krishna
Tu Giatwala Jnana Sunaja Krishna.
Pilathe Pilathe Pilathe Krishna
O Prem bhar Pyala Pilathe Krishna.
Laghaja Laghaja Laghaja Krishna
Meri Nayyaku Para Laghaja Krishna.

Sri Krishna slowly regains consciousness.

(Exit Nrityaranjini)

Lord Krishna: My dear Ranis! Your faces indicate that you are worried over something. I
see traces of tears left on your smooth flowery cheeks. May I know what it is that stands in the way
of my enjoying the sight of the sweet and blissful faces of all of you, my dear ones?

RADHA’S PREM

Rukmini: My Lord. We all serve you, sincerely and devoutly. We love you; we adore you.
Yet you always repeat Radha’s name and show great reverence to it. This pains us greatly. Are we
not superior to Radha in our devotion to you? This thought greatly torments us.

Lord Krishna: Rukmini, you—every one of you—no doubt, serve me with all sincerity, but
as you yourself said just now, you feel you are superior to others on account of your relationship
towards me. When you nourish your ego with such ideas, where is the necessity for me to think of
any of you? But Radha has no such thoughts of herself or her superiority to others. She is
completely merged in me; she has burnt up all her ego. Therefore, I should bring her particularly
into my sphere of protection by always remembering her and attending to her welfare.

Rukmini: My Lord, we can’t follow you. You are rather puzzling us. What do you mean by
saying that Radha has completely merged herself in you and that we have not? Have we not
surrendered ourselves to you completely? Why, we are even prepared to give up our life in your
service!

Lord Krishna: My dear Rukmini, don’t be so impatient. Wait for some time and you will

yourself know.

(After a week Lord Krishna pretended that he had intense pain in His stomach. All His Ranis
and servants were busy procuring medicines and administering them to the Lord. But they found
that the “pain” did not abate. Therefore they begged of Krishna to tell them what they should do.

Lord Krishna: O! The pain is unbearable. What am I to do? (Keeps silent for a few minutes.)
There is only one medicine. I can’t think of any other. It is easy to get; but I don’t know if you will
get it.

Rukmini: Why do you say so, my Lord. We are all ready to sacrifice our lives if you should

need it. Name the medicine and it shall be brought before you have said it.

Lord Krishna: The only cure for stomach-ache is to drink a spoonful of the “Chraranamrita”
of any of my true devotees. My pain will vanish immediately I drink it. Will any of you oblige me by
giving me this medicine? You are all my Bhaktas and you can produce this medicine in the winking
of an eye. O Rukmini! Help me, help me. I can’t bear the pain. I shall lose my life if I am not relieved
of it immediately. O! please Rukmini, get a vessel and let me have a little “Charanamrita”.

(Rukmini is shocked to hear these words. She closes her ears with her hands, looks greatly

perturbed and worried, looks hither and thither like a mad woman.)

Rukmini: My Lord. You are the Lord of three Worlds. I respect you more than I respect any
one else in the world. How can I commit this heinous crime of offering you my Charanamrita? What
a horrible sin would it be, that you want me to commit? Oh, please ask anything else. My life is
yours. (Falls at his feet.)

(Krishna looks at the others.)

10

SCENE II

All: We are ready to serve our Lord in any respect; but how can we give the Lord our

Charanamrita? We will go to Naraka and suffer there for ever.

(All prostrate before the Lord.)

Lord Krishna: O! My pain is increasing every moment. O! Lord, is there not any one here
who would help me. O! Rukmini, if you are not willing, please ask any one of my Bhaktas to give
me the Charanamrita. O! won’t any one take pity on me? ...... Ah! (Krishna swoons.)

Confused as to what they should do, they all disperse willy-nilly.

(After sometime they return one by one.)

Sri Krishna is in the meantime ministered to by one of the Ranis. He slowly opens his eyes.

Rukmini: I tried all the Bhaktas of the palace. None is willing to give Charanamrita for fear

of falling into Naraka.

Satyabhama: I tried all the Bhaktas in the town. They have the same feeling. Oh! Lord.

Suggest some way out of this dilemma.

Lord Krishna: Send a man to Barsana and try there.

(All disperse again except an attendant. Messengers are dispatched to Barsana. One of
them returns after a couple of hours, with a cup of Charanamrita. All are pleased, overjoyed,
Rukmini and the Ranis are astonished. The Charanamrita is offered to Krishna. He drinks and is
relieved of the “pain”. He heaves a sigh of relief.)

Lord Krishna (Smiling): Who is that Bhakta who gave me this medicine?

Kaladas: My Lord, I went to Barsana and asked everybody to give “Charanamrita” for the
Lord. They all took me for a mad man. Some of them shed tears but they could not bring themselves
up to offering Charanamrita to the Lord for fear of falling into hell. I had not passed through two
streets before a lady came running up to me, made me halt and gave me this cup. She was gasping.
In spite of this, she wouldn’t even stop for a breath, but said, “Hurry up to the Lord with this”.
People around us were scolding her “You fool of a Radha! Do you think you are great enough to
offer your Charanamrita to Lord Krishna? Take care, you are committing the greatest sin and you
are sure to suffer in this life and go to hell afterwards”. But she would not pay any heed.

Lord Krishna: Did you not ask her if she was not afraid of Naraka?

Kaladas: Yes, my Lord. But she was impatient, abused me for entering into such arguments
with her and urged me again to go to you first and give this. She asked me to return to her if
necessary, and put her any questions then. I was afraid that she would even beat me; and so took to
my heels.

11

RADHA’S PREM

(Rukmini listens to this narration, speechless.)

Lord Krishna (to Rukmini): Look, Rukmini! Radha is not afraid of Naraka like all of you
here, nor does she revere me so much more than herself (as you do) as to deny me my requirements
or to refuse to carry out my wishes. She feels one with me and acts in a way that would be to my
good. She has no thought for herself and she does not care if she goes to Naraka. Nor is she desirous
of joy in heaven apart from me. When she has no thought for herself, and always thinks of me, is it
not my duty to remember her always and take care of her interests? When each one of you thinks of
your fortune and your sufferings in Naraka, you imagine you can take care of yourselves; why
should I then trouble myself about you?

Rukmini: Good Lord! This is why you made all this fuss about your stomach-ache! But I am

your Jnana Shakti. Why did I not know this answer at first?

Lord Krishna: Because you felt that you were separate from me. This feeling of separation
emanating from egoism should he expunged if you want to develop Parabhakti and merge in me.

All Ranis: Oh! Is this the secret of love? How ignorant were we? And how nicely does our

Lord remove that veil of ignorance!

All sing in chorus.

Kesavaya namostute, jeya Madhavaya namostute

Jnana Dev: My dear Premdas! Do you now understand Radha’s love for Krishna? How
pure, sublime, selfless and dear it is to the Lord! Now that Radha is one with Him; will any of you
try and succeed loving the Lord as selflessly as Radha did, and surrender yourself so completely to
Him that you will be prepared to offer him without question even such a thing as your
Charanamrita? Para-bhakti is not different from Supreme knowledge. In parabhakti the devotee and
Lord are one. The devotee identifies himself with the Lord. The main obstacles to the revelation of
Atman or Truth in us is Egoism. Till we annihilate this, there is not the least chance of the Effulgent
Light of Truth shining in all its splendour. In Parabhakti egoism takes to flight and the devotee no
longer perceives any difference between himself and the Lord. The Parabhakta is thus a great Jnani
also.

Prem Das: Swamiji Maharaj! You have dispelled my life-long doubt and have poured joy
and light into my heart. But how can we practise this Parabhakti to Krishna when He is not living on

SCENE II

this earth in our midst? I envy Radha who had the peculiar good fortune to live when the Lord
incarnated on earth!

Jnana Dev: Yes, but where there is a will, there is a way! I will explain this in great detail

tomorrow. By the way, can’t you stay here for a few days more?

Prem Das: Surely, Swamiji. Should you ask us to stay for few more days in this earthly
paradise? We have to attend a Sankirtan Sammelan presided over by Sri Swami Sivanandaji at
Banares next week. So, we shall leave this place after two days. This Sankirtan tour will last for
another four months. After that, if you permit, we will come and stay here for some considerable
time. We find that you are a Jnani and Bhakta rolled into one.

SCENE III

(Jnana Dev and Prem Das, with his party, assemble under the banyan tree, alter bath,
meditation, Japa, etc. In a corner are seated Murkharaj and his party of friends. Time at about 8
A.M.)

Jnana Dev: Now Prem Dasji, last evening you enquired about the method of developing
pure selfless love for God Sri Krishna in this Yuga when he is not apparently present amongst us.
For a real Bhakta, the Lord is always present—within his heart. He sees him as he sees you, he plays
with him. Haven’t you heard of instances in this Yuga itself to prove this statement?

Prem Das: Yes, Swamiji, I have heard some stories. But how is it possible. At best, I have
seen Bhaktas doing Kirtan before some image. I too am an idolator, but I don’t have any such
experience. I have faith, but I lack Shraddha because......

Murkha Raj: Exactly, how can you expect a piece of stone to talk to you?

Jnana Dev: Oh, what a shame! I did not notice our new friends earlier. Prem Dasji, pardon

me for a few minutes while I make Sri ......

Murkha Raj: Mr. Murkharaj.

Jnana Dev: Sri Murkharaj’s acquaintance. (Turns to Murkharaj) We are indeed blessed
today by your holy visit to this humble abode of the poor. Don’t you feel uncomfortable sitting on
the floor. (To a Brahmachari) Please bring four chairs for these Murtis.

Murkha Raj: Never mind; we are O.K. as we are. (The Brahmachari brings the chairs and
Murkharaj and party seat themselves.) We were just going about sight-seeing and when we saw a
group of huts here we thought we could get some tea here and so dropped in. I now see I was
deceived by a mirage. Thanks for the kind words all the same. Good-bye!

Jnana Dev: Maharaj, please be seated! I shall get some tea prepared for you. (Signals to the

Brahmachari to get tea.)

Tea is brought and Murkharaj and party enjoy a couple of cups each. (In the meantime)

Have you had a pleasant time at Haridwar, Lakshmanjhula, Rishikesh and the other places

you have so far visited? How do you like this part of the country?

Murkha Raj: (Between sips of tea) Yes. The Himalayan scenery is extremely beautiful and
enchanting. We have actually taken some snaps. A whole night we spent absorbed in the natural
beauty of the mountains in moonlight, with this river flowing majestically on..... I must say, minus
these temples and mutts which we have to encounter off and on, our visit has been a most fruitful
one. These really mar the very beauty of the spot....In the temples idols are our gods to be
worshipped and revered! We are certainly living in the Stone Age while the rest of the world has
advanced by leaps and bounds; why shan’t we be, if we are still going to cling to the images! No

wonder the West ridicules our stupidity! (Hands back the cup:) It is very kind of you, thanks.
(Producing a ten-rupee note) what do I pay for the tea?

Jnana Dev: What! Maharaj, you took tea and you are producing a piece of paper in return!

Murkha Raj: (Excited) What do you mean? Do you want me to believe that you are so
innocent and saintly that you don’t know the difference between a scrap of paper and a ten-rupee
currency note? Don’t you see His Majesty’s head printed on it? If I had brought a couple of
policemen with me, I would have had you arrested for undignified remarks against the king. (Looks
at his friends and laughs contemptuously.)

Jnana Dev: Don’t get offended, Maharaj. How could I insult your king. I only said that what
you produced was a piece of paper which in fact it is! That made you lose your temper. You say, the
figure printed on this particular piece of paper, is that of the king and so it is considered valuable.
This is the worst form of idolatry, isn’t it?

(There is loud laughter among those gathered.)

Murkha Raj: (Aside to his friends—feeling insulted.) This is a cunning man. I will tackle
him nicely (To Jnana Dev). The analogy is absurd. You certainly are not trying to compare a king,
who is alive, in flesh and blood, and some imaginary form which you carve out of a piece of stone.
Back to the Stone Age, ha, ha!

Jnana Dev: True, what you say is correct. Pray! Tell me what God is and how you would

like to worship Him.

Murkha Raj: Don’t you know? It is a pity! God is Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent,
Almighty, Parity and Wisdom, and I am sure He is not in need of any worship from you, poor man!
Further where are you going to worship the Omnipresent? It is funny you are able to confine the
Omnipresent, Omnipotent God to a small dungeon which you call your temple!

Jnana Dev: Yes, it seems so. But was God present with you during the whole period of your

wandering?

Murkha Raj: Oh, yes. Certainly.

Jnana Dev: Did you think of that God all the time you were touring?

Murkha Raj: No, why should I? I thought of him only when I had leisure and sometimes
when I was in troubles or difficulties, as this morning when we were almost perishing in this
wretched place without a cup of tea!

Jnana Dev: If you were able to think of God always you could be free from all troubles, as in
this instance, you got your tea in a short time after thinking of Him. If, as you say, He is
Omnipresent, why can’t you think of Him always and everywhere and thus teach a practical way of
worshipping Him to your countrymen?

15

RADHA’S PREM

Murkha Raj: Our minds are not equal to that job. We have even otherwise so much to worry

about that we can’t run after this God always!

Jnana Dev: Well, when you did think of God at times of trouble, as you say, how did you

conceive of His Omnipotence?

Murkha Raj: I thought of Him in the form of Sri Krishna decorated with sweet-smelling
flowers, flute in hand. That is just my artistic conception of beauty. After all, the human mind wants
to perceive something beautiful, loathes the very sight of the ugly, terrible. As a painter and
photographer I have always admired beauty. I have often had to paint for so many customers this
particular form; Krishna, decorated with flowers and flute in one hand......

Jnana Dev: And a cup of tea for you in the other! (Laughter.) Now, tell me was this Form of
Krishna that you thought of when you couldn’t get your tea, an image or abstract quality of
Omnipotence which could bestow on you the desired object?

Murkha Raj: It was certainly an image.

Jnana Dev: Why did you worship an image ? Is an image different from the idol?

Murkha Raj: (Aside to his friends) Heavens, the man is obviously trying to corner me!

Anyway! (To Jnana Dev) An image is not, in its essentials, different from an idol.

Jnana Dev: Do you like to think of God in the coffee-hotel?

Murkha Raj: No, there are other things to think about there—the coffee and the cakes. Why
for that matter, I can’t even think of the new designs I wish to introduce in my paintings inside a
coffee-house. I shut myself up in a room and work late into the night at the canvas; only then can I
hope to concentrate my mind on the work on hand. You see, modern psychology will tell you that
you can concentrate your mind only in a peaceful atmosphere, when you are free from distractions.
Naturally, we can think of God, Nature or Beauty only when we retire to a peaceful place.

Jnana Dev: I too really think like that; but I wonder why we should do so. After all God is

Omnipresent; he is everywhere. Why can’t we think of Him everywhere at all times?

Murkha Raj: I told you; coffee goes with Coffee House, meditation on God with a peaceful
atmosphere. Our minds cannot feel His presence everywhere; only in certain places are we in a
mood to meditate.

Jnana Dev: Then you admit that the human mind is conditioned by time and space!

Murkha Raj: (Aside to his friends) I think he is mad. What’s he talking about—Philosophy

or Utopia? (To Jnana Dev) Yes, it is true.

Jnana Dev: When were you born?

16

SCENE III

Murkha Raj: Why, are you going to start fortune-telling? I was born on 15th January, 1920.

Jnana Dev: Was God existing before your birth?

Murkha Raj: Yes Swamiji, certainly.

Jnana Dev: How do you know? Are you talking of facts known to you or unknown to you?

Murkha Raj: I am talking of facts known to me.

Jnana Dev: When you were born on 15-1-1920, how do you know that God existed before

you were born?

Murkha Raj: Yes, Swamiji. Were you an Advocate-General before you came here? I know I
am being paradoxical. I don’t help contradicting myself. But I feel certain that God existed before
my birth.

Jnana Dev: Very good. It is not so paradoxical as you think. I will explain to you. When you
say you were born on 15-1-1920, you refer to the appearance of your physical body on the earth.
When you feel, by a necessity of thought that God existed before that date, you are voicing out your
inmost soul, which is birthless and deathless like God. Now you understand the limitations of the
human mind, how it
import of Omniscience, Omnipotence,
Omnipresence, etc., but they are merely sound-bubbles for all of us. Therefore, you will have to get
your training on an image for a sufficiently long period before you can have actual and personal
experience of God’s true nature and qualities such as Omnipresence, etc.

is unable to grasp the full

Murkha Raj: True, Swamiji. Man’s constitution is such, that every thought of his contains

some imagery. Without it, the word or the thought is empty and meaningless.

Jnana Dev: Therefore, you see there is no harm in worshipping an image of God, so long as
man has not out-grown his idea of body and this sort of worship is present in every religion in some
form or other. Isn’t it now clear to you how similar this is to the “worship” of your currency note?
Not only that. Take the flag. It is after all a piece of cloth. But when certain symbols are
superimposed on this piece of cloth, it rises greatly in the esteem of the platoon; every soldier is
prepared to give up his life for the sake of the flag! Similarly, the image is very dear to a devotee. It
actually speaks to him in its own language of devotion. Just as the flag arouses martial valour in the
devotee. The Lord is superimposed on the image. All worshippers, however intellectual they may
be, generate a form in the mind—a mental image which is also a form of idol. Hinduism leads the
aspirant gradually from material images to mental images and from the diverse mental images to
the one Personal God and from the Personal God to the Impersonal Absolute or Transcendental
Nirguna Brahman. When you worship an image you do not say “This image has come from Jaipur.
It was brought by Prabhu Singh. Its weight is 50 lbs. It is made of white marble. It cost me Rs.
500/-” You superimpose all the attributes of the Lord on the image and pray “O Antaryamin (Inner
Ruler). You are all-pervading. You are Omnipotent, Omniscient, all-merciful. You are the source
of everything. You are Self-existent. You are Satchidananda. You are eternal, unchanging. You are

RADHA’S PREM

When your devotion and meditation become intense and deep, you do not see the stone image. You
behold the Lord only, who is Chaitanya! This is the Bhakti Marga which is but a training ground for
Jnana.

Murkha Raj: Swamiji, it is getting a bit clear, but I have still some objection to the worship
of God in a particular form. Why should we offer flowers, fruits, incense, etc., to the image, when
we know that neither the image, nor the Nirakara God behind it is in need of it or makes use of them.
This sort of worship does very little credit to the intelligence of our Hindu thinkers.

Jnana Dev: My dear friend, you are mistaken in your ideas. The Sakara worship is intended
as a training ground and a very necessary one at that for man, for realising the Nirakara Brahman
and not for satisfying the needs of the Sakara God or Nirakara God, as you put it. I will illustrate by
examples. Please be attentive.

Murkha Raj: Carry on, I am all attention.

Jnana Dev: Now say...does not the element of water exist in the atmosphere, everywhere in

the subtle form? This is physics, pure and simple.

Murkha Raj: Yes, Swamiji, it does exist.

Jnana Dev: Doesn’t fire exist everywhere—in wood, stone, iron, etc., in a subtle form?

Murkha Raj: Yes.

grapes?

it come from?

Jnana Dev: Does the tree exist in the subtle form in the seed of, say, mango, pineapple,

Murkha Raj: Tree in a seed .......... ? Yes Swamiji, I should say it does; otherwise where does

Jnana Dev: Very well. Now you feel the necessity for water to quench your thirst, or fire to
cook your food, fruits to satisfy your hunger, the shade of a tree to rest for a while from the
scorching heat of the sun. Please tell me what you will do?

Murkha Raj: I will require a cup of water to quench my thirst, an oven to cook my food,

some apple, mango and grapes to satisfy my hunger and shade of a full-grown tree to take rest.

Jnana Dev: Why do you not utilise the water in the atmosphere, the heat in the wood and the
shade of the tree that is in the seed? Can you do this? If you cannot use these things that certainly are
in the Nirakara form for your immediate necessities, how then do you propose to realise the
Nirakara God, when you want solace, peace, happiness as an immediate necessity? Therefore, you
now find the necessity of the worship of the Sakara form of God. It may be Siva, Rama, or Krishna.

Murkha Raj: Thank you, Swamiji. I am very much indebted to you. Now I am satisfied of
the necessity of the Sakara form of worship for men and I will do it from today. But one question

18

SCENE III

more. Is the Nirakara Svarupa of Rama and Krishna different from the Rama and Krishna who were
born in Ayodhya and Mathura?

Jnana Dev: No, certainly not. Both are the same in essence, only you will find it, say, to fix

your mind on the Sakara Rama or Krishna.

Murkha Raj: How do you say that both are the same?

Jnana Dev: Why not? Rama and Krishna were not born like ordinary men.

They came into existence of their own free will to do good to men in their times and to be
models of behaviour of all the future generations. Ordinary people take them to be born of
necessity, but sages and Rishis alone knew their real Svarupa.

Murkha Raj: But how did they have their identity with their Nirakara Svarupa while they

were Sakara forms in this earth?

Jnana Dev: To take up the thread of our analogy. You said the element of fire existed
everywhere. Does not fire visibly exist in the oven, imperceptibly everywhere, perceptibly inside
the oven? You know God is Sarvashaktiman, Omnipotent. The Infinite power of God is an
unfathomable mystery. He can do anything. His essential nature is Intelligence, pure and simple.
That is, He is Infinite Consciousness ITSELF. Through these characteristics, Rama and Krishna
were able to keep their identity with their Nirakara form while acting in their human forms in this
earth plane.

Sat is Ram, Chit is Ram, Anand is Ram,
Santi is Ram, Shakti is Ram, Jyoti is Ram.
Prem is Ram, Mercy is Ram, Beauty is Ram.
Bliss is Ram, Joy is Ram, Purity is Ram.
Refuge, Solace, Path, Lord, Witness is Ram.

Murkha Raj: Thank you, Swamiji. All my doubts have been cleared. You have, as it were,
poured light and love into heart where only darkness and scepticism ruled before. I will engage
myself in Sakara worship from today.

Prem Das: Swamiji, you promised to answer my question of yesterday, how, we are to
practise selfless love for Lord Krishna in this Yuga and you actually began to say something. You
said that to a Bhakta Lord Krishna is always present and the discussion drifted away at Sri
Murkharaj’s interruption.

Jnana Dev: Yes. I will explain to you.

(Rama Hare Shiya Rama Ram.)

Now listen. The most practical way of developing selfless love for Lord Krishna is to adorn
His Image with sweet-smelling flowers, apply sandal-paste, incense and offer eatables and fruits,
sing His glories, repeat His Name at all times and to do prostrations before His Image and feel love
for all men and objects which remind one of Krishna. You should be regular in this practice until the
sound of the Name of Lord Krishna, whether uttered by you or by any other brings out an effusion
of joy as soon as you say or hear it. Repetition of His Name alone will take you to the very portals of
the abode of God. This is the safest, easiest, surest, quickest, cheapest and best way for
God-realisation in this Kaliyuga. The Lord will play with you, eat butter and sugar-candy from your
hands and drink butter-milk from your cup. The joy that Bhaktas derive from this state is beyond
description. Only Bhaktas like Namadev, Mira, Chaitanya Maha Prabhu and Radha know this, feel
this and realise this. Bhaktas find satisfaction only in repeating His Name and they dance with Him
in ecstasy. May the Lord grant you all, proper understanding and a pure and subtle intellect to
understand these matters in their true perspective.

Murkha Raj: Swamiji, I don’t see how a man can obtain Self-realisation by uttering the

Name.

Jnana Dev: My dear friend. Today it is time for our evening ablutions. We are very punctual
in our daily service to the Lord. Therefore, I suggest, you stay here for the day. We shall all
assemble again tomorrow at 10 a.m. here. I will clear your doubt then.

SCENE IV

Murkha Raj: Swamiji, after last evening’s discussion here, I thought about the whole
matter, and I feel that after all my original conception and yours of God are essentially the same;
only yours is more concrete and so is more appealing to every one. But as I said yesterday at the
close of the meeting I wonder what effect the mere repetition of a Name can have! Of course,
science tells us that concentration of the mind is necessary to achieve any great result in any walk of
life; that all the discoveries have been brought about by the inventor meditating deeply on the object
he chose. Hence, it is clear that in the philosophical field also concentration and meditation are
absolutely necessary. And, yesterday, I learnt that a form is essential in the initial stages before
stepping on to formless meditation. Why not stop there? I thought I was seeing things clearly when
you suddenly switched on to the topic of the repetition of Name. That seems to be all wrong and
very unscientific. I have come across so many people who go on rolling the beads and shouting
“Ram, Ram”; but I consider they are all mere humbugs. What do they achieve by it? What are your
views on this point? Do you consider it......

(There was interruption by a boy of 12 years running into their midst post-haste crying

“Tiger”, “Tiger” and taking shelter.)

Murkha Raj: Dayal! Get me that six-chamber revolver.

Prem Das: O! Don’t kill it. Let us hide ourselves somewhere.

Dayal Chand (A follower of Murkharaj): My friends. Take care of the ladies and lead them

(Runs away hastily.)

on to a safe place.

Jnana Dev: Let me see that tiger.

(The tiger comes and stands before him and quietly lies down. The skin of the tiger falls

down and a large hunting dog emerges out of it) (Calls aloud)

My friends. Come on. There was much ado about nothing. This is only a big dog in tiger’s

skin.

(All return to the garden)

Jnana Dev: This incident forms, as it were, a fitting prelude for my answer to your question.

Murkha Raj: How? You mean the “Name” business.

Jnana Dev: Please see the electrical effect of the word “Tiger” in the ears of different
persons assembled here. You wanted to attack it with a revolver; Prem Das wanted to hide himself,
and your friend Dayalchand wanted to secure the safety of the weaker sex against its attack and I
wanted to see what kind of tiger it was. If such is the commotion produced by the word “Tiger” what
would be the effect produced by the Name of the Almighty God in every one of us, though we may
possibly respond to it differently, according to our characters?

23

RADHA’S PREM

Murkha Raj: True, Swamiji. When it is a question of life and death our minds act

electrically to words. But under ordinary circumstances, they are not so much alert to words.

Jnana Dev: My dear friends. Now tell me after retracing your memory to your childhood,
how your knowledge was acquired and expanded. It was certainly by the words conveying ideas of
objects by others—parents, friends and teachers. In higher education you get ideas of great abstract
principles and laws of Nature by meditating on words embodying them. Without the use of words,
no kind of knowledge was acquired by any of us. This is the law of Nature.

Murkha Raj: Quite so.

Jnana Dev: The seven planes of Nature can be described by words and the ideas about them
conveyed to others only by suitable words. These are called “Sabda Lokas” meaning that the worlds
can be known by the use of sound. In Western science, sound is supposed to be produced by
sound-waves in the air or ether but according to the Hindu scriptures, sound is produced, retained,
and dissolved by a substance called “Nada Bindu” a very subtle force of God by which He creates,
sustains and involves the whole of this Universe. The vibrations of the Mantras are active while the
Universe is manifested and potentially passive while the Universe is involved. A particular sound is
a mass of psychic force capable of producing definite forms in the outside world. This has been
verified by experiments. A “Mantra” is therefore a mass of potential knowledge, which can be
released and made kinetic by a person repeating it a number of times. A person gets a clear idea of
the nature and form of a person denoted by it, after repeating its name for a sufficient number of
times.

Murkha Raj: What is meant by the law of association and has it anything to do with the

repetition of the Name of God?

Jnana Dev: The law of association is that of the mind associating an imagery whether
visual, olfactory, cutaneous, savoury or auditory with the sound of the word. When this law is
fulfilled, it is for the mind to remember many things and thus get a knowledge of those objects. For
every “Mantra” there is a particular Deity as its basis and ideal and it is the duty of the Sadhaka to
associate this image of the Deity with the sound of the Mantra. Thus the mind of the Sadhaka is
filled with the qualities of the Deity. “Think and you become that” is the law. This is especially so at
the time of the departure of the soul from this embodiment. The “last impression” is very potent in
its effect. It is on this principle, Lord Krishna says in Gita. “Whosoever a man remembers at the
time of separation from this body, to that the man attains.” And if you remember God at the time of
your death, you will certainly attain Him. But if you have any worldly desire you have to suffer the
human birth once again. One good opportunity is lost. Your salvation or further prolongation of this
birth-death-disease depends on what you do. But with a little precaution you could have avoided all
that. So, think of Him with your last breath and be assured that this is your last birth.

Murkha Raj: This is strange and seems opposed to all reason. Do you mean to say that a man
who has been leading a virtuous life throughout and who has a desire when he is at the point of
death, is born again, whereas one who has been an evil doer throughout his life, if he thinks of God
at the time of his death attains immortality?

24

SCENE IV

Jnana Dev: Quite so. It looks strange. I will explain it by means of an illustration. You said
you were a photographer. Tell me, please, what do you do when you want to take a photograph of
me.

Murkha Raj (Takes out his camera.): I first adjust the camera so that I get a clear image of
my object. Sometimes I have to arrange the object also to get a good impression. Then I adjust the
lens. It is done like this, you see. (Demonstrates.)

Jnana Dev: Then?

Jnana Dev: Oh! Don’t shoot me!

Murkha Raj: I adjust the sensitive plate. Every thing is now ready for the “shooting”.

Murkha Raj: No, no, I won’t kill you. Don’t be afraid! When I have put the sensitive plate
in, I warn the man not to shake. Now, don’t shake! Steady please! (He presses the button.) Now I
have taken your photograph. I will say in the customary way “Thank you”!

Jnana Dev: Supposing I moved a bit when you “clicked”?

Murkha Raj: The photo will not be well defined.

Jnana Dev: Suppose a person who was not steady before exposure, makes himself steady at

the time of the exposure?

Murkha Raj: His photo will be all right.

Jnana Dev: You yourself have got an answer to the question you put!

Murkha Raj: Well.....Yes. I now understand it. But why should a man utter the Mantra

always? Is it not enough to utter it once at the time of death only.

Jnana Dev: Well asked. That would make it easy, wouldn’t

this Divine
Photographer, unlike the mundane one, does not shout “Ready please”. We don’t know when we
will hear the click of the camera. So we have to be ever ready. Any moment the photo may be taken.
Be always alert so that whenever you have to leave the body you will do so with His Name on your
lips. The Name purifies. The Name ennobles. The Name softens the heart. The Name removes all
sins. Utter His Name with full faith, devotion and feeling once and you are freed from all sins.

it? But

Murkha Raj: Excuse me, Swamiji. You are again creating some doubt in my mind. If I shall
be freed by uttering His Name once, why should I go on repeating it? After I am freed from sin, even
if I am to die any moment, I will only go to heaven.

Jnana Dev: I shall give you an example to illustrate the Truth behind this. Take the case of a

lantern—what is its purpose?

25

RADHA’S PREM

Murkha Raj: It is there to remove darkness during night when we light the lantern.

Jnana Dev: All right. When once the lantern is lit, is not the darkness removed?

Murkha Raj: Yes.

Jnana Dev: Can we put out the lantern when once the darkness is removed?

Murkha Raj: If we put out the lantern, there will be darkness again?

Jnana Dev: That is the answer to your question then. Sins are removed by uttering the

Mantra once, but they will again come to you when you stop uttering the Mantra.

(Exclaims.)

Murkha Raj: Good God! Where is an end to this?

Jnana Dev: When do you put out the lantern?

Murkha Raj: When day breaks and there is the light of the Sun.

Jnana Dev: Similarly, you will have to utter the Mantra till the Sun of knowledge arises in
you, that is, till Self-realisation is attained. Japa of God’s Name, every day of our life, is quite easy
for everybody. One can mould his character in the image of God and can also determine what the
state of mind should be at the time of death. Your character and conduct during your life in this body
will determine the state of your mind at that time and it is therefore necessary that we should have
spent our time in thoughts of God during our entire life-time.

Name of the Lord gives immense bliss,
All great sins in a moment vanish.
Untie the bundle of your sins.
Name of Prabhu liberated Ahalya.

Murkha Raj:—Swamiji! We are deeply grateful to you for your kind and eloquent
discourse. I think of doing Japa and meditation on the form of Lord Krishna from today. Will you
tell me which Mantra I Should repeat?

Jnana Dev: You can repeat the Maha Mantra. Don’t change this Mantra for some other till
the end of your life. After all, there is no superior Mantra or inferior Mantra; all Mantras have the
same effect and lead to the same goal. Stick to this Mantra and repeat it with devotion and full faith.
Be firm in your conviction that you will soon attain your goal of Self-realisation through the
repetition of this Mantra. By the way, tomorrow Swami Atmanandaji, a Yogi, will be visiting this
Ashram. We will all assemble here at 7 a.m. tomorrow. If you wish you can leave for your place

Murkha Raj: Swamiji, your performance is very elevating. Of all the instruments, this flute
has a peculiar marvellous effect and makes the listener forget himself. Is that the reason why Sri
Krishna is supposed to keep this instrument always with him and play on it incessantly? Not a
picture of Krishna have I seen without this magic wand.

Atmanandaji: Yes, you are correct. The flute is the instrument which is dearest to our Lord.
In the divine music pouring forth from His flute, all the Gopis and even cattle used to lose their
body-consciousness. But, there is a sublime philosophical truth hidden behind this apparently
commonplace feature. For people who take only an ephemeral interest in the Lord’s Lila, they are
all nothing but mere human actions. But to a Bhakta who is always contemplating on His Lilas and
takes delight in hearing about Him, His Lilas are full of spiritual significance. He dives deeper and
deeper till he comes upon the Divine Pearl of Supreme Knowledge. I will tell you a story about
Krishna’s flute:

(Sings)

Anandoham, Anandoham, Anandam, Brahmanandam.
Vyapaka Chetana Atma Sivoham,
Vyakta-Avyakta Svarupa Sivoham.
Nitya Suddha Niramaya Soham.
Nityananda Niranjana Soham.

Lord Krishna loved to keep always His Bansuri with Him. He never parted with it. The flute
is the symbol of Pranava. It is this flute that attracted the Gopis, the maidens of Vraja to meet their
beloved Lord on the banks of the Yamuna. The divine melody of the flute was enchanting. It had
wonderful power. When it entered the core of the heart through the cavity of the ears it made the
hearer forget all his dear relations, the world and even his own self. It made the hearer dance in
ecstasy and filled his heart with pure love. The sound of this flute thrilled the heart with rapturous
delight and instilled new life and joy. It produced God-intoxication in all beings and infused life
even in insentient objects. The sweetness of the music was unsurpassed. He who heard once the
music of Krishna’s flute cared not for the nectar of heaven or the bliss of Moksha. The flute and its
music stirred the soul of the Gopis. They lost themselves in the music. The world was nothing for

28

SCENE V

them. They had neither shame nor fear to deter them from leaving their homes. Who can resist the
torrent of the divine musical call of the Lord? It brought to the banks of the Yamuna, the flying
birds, wandering cows, the roaming deer and made them gaze at Krishna, forgetful of themselves.
The trees, plants and creepers did not rustle; so attentive were they to the music of their Lord.
Complete silence prevailed except for the thrilling notes of the flute which completely filled the
atmosphere with divine vibrations. No wonder, the Lord used to say that He would even part with
His body but not with His flute. So dear to him was his flute. Radha and the Gopis became jealous of
the flute, as it had the rare fortune of perpetually tasting the nectar of Lord Krishna’s lips which was
denied to them though they pined for it. They all determined to steal it and break it to pieces. What
wouldn’t women do out of jealousy!

One day, after “Rasa Lila”, when they noticed that their beloved Krishna was tired, they
asked Him to take rest for a while and prepared a bed of wild flowers with their clothes spread Over.
Lord Krishna knew their innermost thoughts but pretended deep sleep. Radha with the help of other
Sakhis—Lalita, Bishaka, Nirmala, took the Bansuri slowly out of the hands of Krishna and hid it
under a tree. Radha then left the place. The Gopis were then engaged in their seemingly innocent
plays, songs and dance. After some time, Lord Krishna woke up with a shudder, found his Bansuri
missing and looked here and there like a mad man.

(HE APPROACHES EVERY GOPI AND ENQUIRES ABOUT THE FLUTE)

Krishna (to Lalita): Where is my Bansuri, Lalita?

Lalita: I don’t know. Why should I tell you where it is even if I know?

Bishaka: I am not your sentry, I don’t know anything about the blessed Bansuri. You did not

give it to me either; then what is the fun of your asking me about it?

(Krishna turns to Bishaka)

(Krishna turns to Nirmala)

Nirmala: You are really mad, Krishna. You did not bring your Bansuri at all, today. I saw
you coming empty-handed. Have you been dreaming about the Bansuri? Ah, yes, that is why you
woke up with a shudder.

Lord Krishna: Nirmala! I have a full memory of what I did today. I did bring the Bansuri

here. Please tell me—where it is.

Nirmala: I thought till now that you had only the bad habit of relieving others of their
possessions against their will or without their knowledge. It is only now I find that you are a liar
besides being a thief.

Krishna: I steal others’ property because they cannot willingly throw away their burdens
and enter into the Satchidananda Bliss. I speak of things as false and deceptive which others
consider true and everlasting. I am a liar to a liar and a thief to a thief. This is quite true. But,

29

RADHA’S PREM

Nirmala, don’t worry about all that philosophy now. Please give me my Bansuri and I will tell you
all that you need know about everything. (Sits down by her side and strokes her cheek). You are my
true and faithful companion, I know. Please give me my Bansuri.

Nirmala: Krishna, you are dearer to me than my own life. Do you think I will make fun of

you?

(Lord Krishna asks every Gopi. All deny any knowledge of the flute. Then he finds that

Radha was missing and asks of the Gopis about her whereabouts.)

Nirmala: We do not know. Perhaps she did not come today. Or, she might have returned
earlier than usual. You and she are so dear to each other that you both move in close intimacy, you
alone know of her whereabouts.

(Krishna began to search for Radha, singing.)

Jaya Radhe, Jaya Radhe Radhe Jaya Radhe Jaya Sri Radhe.

before I could get rid of my tiresomeness you have made me ten times more weary by disappearing
suddenly! What a love you have for me. See, I went round and round this forest in search of you and
here you are sitting coolly all alone. Why are you so selfish, Radha?

Radha: I am the master of my own fancies. Who are you to question that?

Krishna: What about me? You are my Controller, Radha.

Radha: Aey, don’t go on flattering me. I know there is something behind these words. You
won’t talk in this fashion without some purpose. Now, what do you want? Haven’t we danced
enough for today? Then why don’t you leave me alone?

Krishna: You are a thought-reader, Radha. I come to ask you about my flute. Only you

know where it is. I was fast asleep and woke up to find it missing.

Radha: Hare, what is this? What do I know about it? Was it for this you wasted all your
energy, hunting me out? Poor Krishna! Go, go! Leave me alone. And, all this worry for a little piece
of bamboo. See, there is a forest of bamboos. Why don’t you cut a piece from one of the trees and be
done with it? It is this piece of bamboo that made you extol me to the skies all the time suspecting
that I would have stolen it. What a love you pretend to have for me!

Krishna: Radha, do you still have any doubt that you are the life of my life? The flute is not a

piece of bamboo. It is dear to me as my life and I cannot have peace of mind without it.

Radha: If it is so dear to you, you ought to have guarded it scrupulously or asked me to
guard it for you. What are you doing with that blessed Bansuri, that you should get peace only from
it?

Krishna: I do everything through the flute. I assemble the cows of Vraja by its clarion call,
pour love and joy into the hearts of the Gopis and melt the minds of the animate and inanimate
beings. Though I am one without a second, the one Nirakara Brahman, I have to pour joy and music
into the hearts of the advanced Bhaktas like the Gopis through their soul and I assemble the dull
Bhaktas like the cows with the music of the flute and feed them with the fruits of their Karmas under
my supervision and they respond to my call by repeating my name (one amongst a thousand and
eight), and instruct them into the mysteries of the Sakara and Nirakara Brahman after cleansing
their intellect and making them grasp the subtle truths. The minds of the most Tamasic and
hard-hearted souls are also melted to hear of me my songs and glories and Leelas. Thus I do my
universal supervision only through my Bansuri. If anybody wants to taste the nectarine sweetness
of my lips, he should empty himself of his egoism completely, as the Bansuri empties itself quickly
so that I may fill it with my music and keep it always near my lips. Now, Radha, don’t make me
more miserable. Please let me have it.

Radha: O dear! What a fortunate thing, this Bansuri? I envy its position near your lips. That

is by the way; but I don’t know where it is.

Krishna: Radha, please. Radha don’t persist in this affected ignorance. You will repent for

your behaviour afterwards!

(When Krishna is out of sight, Radha and the Gopis assemble and break the flute. To their

surprise, every piece begins to dance and sing.)

(There was a garden of Bansuris. All became astonished and frightened. They look at each
other and begin to catch hold of the dancing Bansuris. They could not catch even one. Not knowing
what to do, they call Krishna to their aid.)

Krishna: Why did you hide my Bansuri and break it?

All (Prostrating): We did it out of ignorance. We were jealous of it. So we broke it. Pardon

us, Lord.

Krishna: Give me, Radha, that broken piece of Bansuri in your hand.

(Radha gives it. He receives it and it assumes its original size. The dancing Bansuris

Atmanandaji: Such is the glory and secret of Lord Krishna’s flute.

Murkha Raj: What a sublime idea have you put into this simple story! Most of us, Swamiji,
study these Puranas with a prejudiced mind. We catch hold of some superficial aspects of these
Puranas and at once begin to criticise and condemn them. I wish a few wise men like you toured the
country and helped disillusioned people to get rid of such stupid notions as now cover their
intelligence and mould their intellect. (Turns to Jnana Dev) I came here in search of a cup of tea, but
got a cup of nectar. What a shame! What a crime did I commit by characterising the Mahatmas here
as a set of dull-headed idlers! But I now find that they are each one of them a fountain head of
supreme knowledge. I must ask you to pardon this unintentional wrong done to you. My friends and
I will form the first group of propagandists of the Divine Cause.

Jnana Dev: It is through God’s Grace and your own good Samskaras that you were able to
come here. The work you have now undertaken to do is also His work. His ways are inscrutable.
Throw the burden on Him and do what all you can to the betterment of mankind. You would then
have done your duty entrusted by Him. Never fear public opinion. At first people might laugh at

you; but he laughs best who laughs last. The worldly man sends out peels of laughter but the wise
one smiles through his eyes. Come here every year to recharge your battery of spiritual strength.

(All sing in chorus–Jnana Dev leading Atmanandaji plays on his flute.)

Sri Gokulke Rahne Vala Jaya Jaya Jaya Nandalala.
